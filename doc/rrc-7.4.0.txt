4.1	Overview of the specification
This specification is organised as follows:
-	subclause 4.2 contains the description of the model of the RRC protocol layer;
-	clause 5 lists the RRC functions and the services provided to upper layers;
-	clause 6 lists the services expected from the lower layers and specifies the radio bearers available for usage by the RRC messages;
-	clause 7 specifies the UE states for the Access Stratum, and also specifies the processes running in the UE in the respective states;
-	clause 8 specifies RRC procedures, including UE state transitions;
-	clause 9 specifies the procedures for the handling of unknown, unforeseen, and erroneous protocol data by the receiving entity;
-	clause 10 describes the message in a Tabular format; these messages descriptions are referenced in clause 8;

-	clause 14 specifies some of the processes applicable in UTRA RRC connected mode e.g. measurement processes, and also the RRC information to be transferred between network nodes. Note that not all the processes applicable in UTRA RRC connected mode are specified here i.e. some UTRA RRC connected mode processes are described in [4] e.g. cell re-selection;
-	Annex A contains recommendations about the network parameters to be stored on the USIM;
-	Annex B contains informative Stage 2 description of the RRC protocol states and state transitions.
The following figure summarises the mapping of UE states, including states in GSM, to the appropriate UTRA and GSM specifications that specify the UE behaviour.

Figure 4.1-1: Mapping of UE state to 3GPP Specifications
4.2	RRC Layer Model
The functional entities of the RRC layer are described below:
-	Routing of higher layer messages to different MM/CM entities (UE side) or different core network domains (UTRAN side) is handled by the Routing Function Entity (RFE).
-	Broadcast functions are handled in the broadcast control function entity (BCFE). The BCFE is used to deliver the RRC services, which are required at the GC-SAP. The BCFE can use the lower layer services provided by the Tr-SAP and UM-SAP.
-	Paging of UEs that do not have an RRC connection is controlled by the paging and notification control function entity (PNFE). The PNFE is used to deliver the RRC services that are required at the Nt-SAP. The PNFE can use the lower layer services provided by the Tr-SAP and UM-SAP.
-	The Dedicated Control Function Entity (DCFE) handles all functions specific to one UE. The DCFE is used to deliver the RRC services that are required at the DC-SAP and can use lower layer services of UM/AM-SAP and Tr-SAP depending on the message to be sent and on the current UE service state.
-	In TDD mode, the DCFE is assisted by the Shared Control Function Entity (SCFE) location in the C-RNC, which controls the allocation of the PDSCH and PUSCH using lower layers services of UM-SAP and Tr-SAP.
-	The Transfer Mode Entity (TME) handles the mapping between the different entities inside the RRC layer and the SAPs provided by RLC.
NOTE 1:	Logical information exchange is necessary also between the RRC sublayer functional entities. Most of that is implementation dependent and not necessary to present in detail in a specification.
Figure 4.2-1 shows the RRC model for the UE and Figure 4.2-2 and Figure 4.2-3 show the RRC model for the UTRAN.
NOTE 2:	The figure shows only the types of SAPs that are used. Multiple instances of Tr-SAP, UM-SAP and AM-SAP are possible. Especially, different functional entities usually use different instances of SAP types.

4.3	Protocol specification principles
This protocol specification is based on the applicable general guidelines given in [14].
In this specification, a notation of variables is used. The variables are defined in subclause 13.4. Variables are typically used to represent a status or a result of an action, such as reception of an information element in a message, which is used to specify a behaviour somewhere else in the specification, such as when setting the value of an information element in a transmitted message. The variables only serve the purpose of specifying the protocol, and do not therefore impose any particular implementation.
When specifying the UE behaviour at reception of messages, the behaviour that is tied to reception or non-reception of individual information elements, and in some cases combinations of information elements, is specified in one location (subclause 8.6).
5	RRC Functions and Services provided to upper layers
5.1	RRC Functions
The RRC performs the functions listed below. A more detailed description of these functions is provided in [2]:
-	Broadcast of information related to the non-access stratum (Core Network);
-	Broadcast of information related to the access stratum;
-	Establishment, maintenance and release of an RRC connection between the UE and UTRAN;
-	Establishment, reconfiguration and release p-t-p of Radio Bearers;
-	Establishment, reconfiguration and release of p-t-m Radio Bearers;
-	Assignment, reconfiguration and release of radio resources for the RRC connection;
-	RRC connection mobility functions;
-	Control of requested QoS;
-	UE measurement reporting and control of the reporting;
-	Outer loop power control;
-	Control of ciphering;
-	Slow DCA (TDD mode);
-	Paging;
-	Initial cell selection and cell re-selection;
-	Arbitration of radio resources on uplink DCH;
-	RRC message integrity protection;
-	Timing advance (TDD mode);
-	CBS control;
-	MBMS control.
5.2	RRC Services provided to upper layers
The RRC offers the following services to upper layers, a description and primitives of these services are provided in [2] and [17].
-	General Control;
-	Notification;
-	Dedicated control.
The RRC layer provides the UE-UTRAN portion of signalling connections to the upper layers to support the exchange of upper layer's information flow. The signalling connection is used between the user equipment and the core network to transfer upper layer information. For each core network domain, at most one signalling connection may exist at the same time. The RRC layer maps the signalling connections for one UE on a single RRC connection. For the upper layer data transfer on signalling connections, the RRC layer supports the discrimination between two different classes, named "High priority" (corresponding to "SAPI 0" for a GSM-MAP based core network) and "Low priority" (corresponding to "SAPI 3" for a GSM-MAP based core network).
5.3	Primitives between RRC and upper layers
The primitives between RRC and the upper layers are described in [17].
6	Services expected from lower layers
6.1	Services expected from Layer 2
The services provided by layer 2 are described in [2], [15] and [16].
6.2	Services expected from Layer 1
The services provided by layer 1 are described in [2].
6.3	Signalling Radio Bearers
The Radio Bearers (RB) available for transmission of RRC messages are defined as "signalling radio bearers" and are specified in the following. The UE and UTRAN shall select the signalling radio bearers for RRC messages using RLC-TM, RLC-UM or RLC-AM on the DCCH and CCCH, according to the following:
-	Signalling radio bearer RB0 shall be used for all messages sent on the CCCH (UL: RLC-TM, DL: RLC-UM).
-	Signalling radio bearer RB1 shall be used for all messages sent on the DCCH, when using RLC unacknowledged mode (RLC-UM).
-	Signalling radio bearer RB2 shall be used for all messages sent on the DCCH, when using RLC acknowledged mode (RLC-AM), except for the RRC messages carrying higher layer (NAS) signalling.
-	Signalling radio bearer RB3 and optionally Signalling radio bearer RB4 shall be used for the RRC messages carrying higher layer (NAS) signalling and sent on the DCCH in RLC acknowledged mode (RLC-AM), as specified in subclauses 8.1.8., 8.1.9 and 8.1.10.
-	Additionally, RBs whose identities shall be set between 5 and 32 may be used as signalling radio bearer for the RRC messages on the DCCH sent in RLC transparent mode (RLC-TM).
-	RRC messages on the SHCCH are mapped either on RACH or on the USCH in the uplink using TM and either on FACH or on the DSCH using RLC-UM. These messages are only specified for TDD mode.
-	RRC messages on the MCCH are mapped on FACH using RLC-UM. The transport channel configuration for MCCH is indicated on BCCH. For this signalling radio bearer no identity is applied.
-	RRC messages on the MSCH are mapped on FACH using RLC-UM. The transport channel configuration for MSCH is indicated on MCCH. For this signalling radio bearer no identity is applied.
The Radio Bearer configuration for signalling radio bearer RB0, SHCCH, BCCH on FACH, PCCH on PCH and BCCH mapped to BCH are specified in subclauses 13.6, 13.6a, 13.6b and 13.6c.
Ciphering is never applied to signalling radio bearer RB0 or signalling radio bearers using RLC TM.
7	Protocol states
7.1	Overview of RRC States and State Transitions including GSM
Figure 7.1-1 shows the RRC states in UTRA RRC Connected Mode, including transitions between UTRA RRC connected mode and GSM connected mode for CS domain services, and between UTRA RRC connected mode and GSM/GPRS packet modes for PS domain services. It also shows the transitions between Idle Mode and UTRA RRC Connected Mode and furthermore the transitions within UTRA RRC connected mode. 

NOTE:	1: The indicated division within Idle Mode is only included for clarification and shall not be interpreted as states.
Figure 7.1-1: RRC States and State Transitions including GSM
The RRC connection is defined as a point-to-point bi-directional connection between RRC peer entities in the UE and the UTRAN characterised by the allocation of a U-RNTI. A UE has either zero or one RRC connection.
If NAS informs AS about a new selected PLMN, registered PLMN or equivalent PLMN list while being in connected mode, the UE shall perform the actions according to subclause 8.5.24.
NOTE:	The state transitions are specified in clause 8.
7.2	Processes in UE modes/states

NOTE:	If any of the above procedures results in different HS-DSCH and E-DCH serving cells, the UE behaviour is unspecified.
8	RRC procedures
The UE shall be able to process several simultaneous RRC procedures. After the reception of a message which invoked a procedure, the UE shall be prepared to receive and act on another message which may invoke a second procedure. Whether this second invocation of a procedure (transaction) is accepted or rejected by the UE is specified in the subclauses of this clause, and in particular in subclause 8.6.3.11 (RRC transaction identifier).
On receiving a message the UE shall:
1>	check that the message is addressed to the UE (e.g. by checking the IE "Initial UE identity" or the IE "U-RNTI" for messages on CCCH);
1>	discard the messages addressed to other UEs.
and then the UE shall:
1>	apply integrity check as appropriate;
1>	proceed with error handling as specified in clause 9;
1>	act upon the IE "RRC transaction identifier";
1>	continue with the procedure as specified in the relevant subclause.
NOTE:	Due to an error in the Release '99 ASN.1, a Release '99 UE is unable to determine which UE is addressed by a downlink CCCH message corresponding to a protocol version later than Release '99. As a result, the Release '99 UE will not be able to return a protocol error according to subclause 9.3a. Therefore, the UTRAN should only send a Release '99 message version towards UEs that have indicated conformance to Release '99 in the IE "Access stratum release indicator".
The RRC entity in the UE shall consider PDUs to have been transmitted when they are submitted to the lower layers. If the RRC entity in the UE submits a message for transmission using AM RLC, it shall consider the message successfully transmitted when UTRAN reception of all relevant PDUs is acknowledged by RLC. In the UE, timers are started when the PDUs are sent on the radio interface in the case of the transmission using the CCCH.
8.1	RRC Connection Management Procedures
8.1.1	Broadcast of system information

Figure 8.1.1-1: Broadcast of system information

CELL_PCH state and URA_PCH state

Figure 8.1.1-3: Notification of system information modification for UEs in CELL_FACH and CELL_DCH(TDD only)  state
8.1.1.1	General
The purpose of this procedure is to broadcast system information from the UTRAN to UEs in a cell.
8.1.1.1.1	System information structure
The system information elements are broadcast in system information blocks. A system information block groups together system information elements of the same nature. Different system information blocks may have different characteristics, e.g. regarding their repetition rate and the requirements on UEs to re-read the system information blocks.
The system information is organised as a tree. A master information block gives references and scheduling information to a number of system information blocks in a cell. The system information blocks contain the actual system information. The master information block may optionally also contain reference and scheduling information to one or two scheduling blocks, which give references and scheduling information for additional system information blocks. Scheduling information for a system information block may only be included in either the master information block or one of the scheduling blocks.
For all system information blocks except System Information Block types 15.2, 15.3 and 16, the content is the same in each occurrence for system information blocks using value tag. System Information Block types 15.2, 15.3 and 16 may occur more than once with different content. In this case scheduling information is provided for each such occurrence of the system information block. System information blocks that do not use value tag may have different content for each occurrence.
8.1.1.1.2	System information blocks
Table 8.1.1 specifies all system information blocks and their characteristics.
The area scope column in table 8.1.1 specifies the area where a system information block's value tag is valid. If the area scope is cell, the UE shall consider the system information block to be valid only in the cell in which it was read. If system information blocks have been previously stored for this cell, the UE shall check whether the value tag for the system information block in the entered cell is different compared to the stored value tag. If the area scope is PLMN or Equivalent PLMN, the UE shall check the value tag for the system information block when a new cell is selected. If the value tag for the system information block in the new cell is different compared to the value tag for the system information block stored in the UE, the UE shall re-read the system information block. If the area scope is PLMN, the UE shall consider the system information block to be valid only within the PLMN in which it was read. If the area scope is Equivalent PLMN, the UE shall consider the system information block to be valid within the PLMN in which it was received and all PLMNs which are indicated by higher layers to be equivalent.
For System information block types 15.2, 15.3 and 16, which may have multiple occurrences, each occurrence has its own independent value tag. The UE- shall re-read a particular occurrence if the value tag of this occurrence has changed compared to that stored in the UE.
The UE mode/state column when block is valid in Table 8.1.1 specifies in which UE mode or UE state the IEs in a system information block shall be regarded as valid by the UE. In other words, the indicated system information block becomes invalid upon change to a mode/state that is not included in this column. System Information Block Type 16 remains also valid upon transition to or from GSM/GPRS. In some cases, the states are inserted in brackets to indicate that the validity is dependent on the broadcast of the associated System Information Blocks by the network as explained in the relevant procedure subclause.
The UE mode/state column when block is read in Table 8.1.1 specifies in which UE mode or UE state the IEs in a system information block may be read by the UE. The UE shall have the necessary information prior to execution of any procedure requiring information to be obtained from the appropriate system information block. The requirements on the UE in terms of when to read the system information may therefore be derived from the procedure specifications that specify which IEs are required in the different UE modes/states in conjunction with the different performance requirements that are specified. 
The UE shall:
1>	if variable DEFERRED_MEASUREMENT_STATUS is set to FALSE:
2>	if System Information Block type 11 is referenced in the master information block or in the scheduling blocks:
3>	if System Information Block type 12 is not referenced in the master information block or in the scheduling blocks , or broadcast of System Information Block type 12 is not indicated in System Information Block type 11:
4>	have read and acted upon System Information Block type 11 and System Information Block type 11bis, if scheduled on BCH, in a cell when the UE transmits an RRC message on RACH. 
3>	else:
4>	have read and acted upon System Information Block type 11 and System Information Block type 11bis, if scheduled on BCH, in a cell before the UE transmits the RRC CONNECTION REQUEST message. 
4>	have read and acted upon both System Information Block type 11 and System Information Block type 11bis, if scheduled on BCH, and System Information Block type 12 in a cell when:
5>	the UE transmits an RRC message on RACH in RRC connected mode; or
5>	the UE receives a message commanding to enter Cell_DCH state.
1>	else:
2>	the UE may transmit an RRC message on RACH before having read and acted upon System Information Block type 11, System Information Block type 11bis and System Information Block type 12, if scheduled on BCH.
NOTE 1:	There are a number of system information blocks that include the same IEs while the UE mode/state in which the information is valid differs. This approach is intended to allows the use of different IE values in different UE mode/states.
NOTE 2:	System Information Block Type 16 is also obtained by a UE while in GSM/GPRS. The details of this are not within the scope of this specification.
The Scheduling information column in table 8.1.1 specifies the position and repetition period for the System Information Block.
The modification of system information column in table 8.1.1 specifies the update mechanisms applicable for a certain system information block. For system information blocks with a value tag, the UE shall update the information according to subclause 8.1.1.7.1 or 8.1.1.7.2. For system information blocks with an expiration timer, the UE shall, when the timer expires, perform an update of the information according to subclause 8.1.1.7.4.

8.1.1.1.3	Segmentation and concatenation of system information blocks
A generic SYSTEM INFORMATION message is used to convey the system information blocks on the BCCH. A given BCCH may be mapped onto either a BCH or a FACH transport channel according to subclause 8.1.1.1.2. The size of the SYSTEM INFORMATION message shall fit the size of a BCH or a FACH transport block.
The RRC layer in UTRAN performs segmentation and concatenation of encoded system information blocks. If the encoded system information block is larger than the size of a SYSTEM INFORMATION message, it will be segmented and transmitted in several messages. If the encoded system information block is smaller than a SYSTEM INFORMATION message, UTRAN may concatenate several system information blocks, or the first segment or the last segment into the same message as specified in the remainder of this clause.
Four different segment types are defined:
-	First segment;
-	Subsequent segment;
-	Last segment;
-	Complete.
Each of the types - First, Subsequent and Last segment - is used to transfer segments of a master information block, scheduling block or a system information block. The segment type, Complete, is used to transfer a complete master information block, complete scheduling block or a complete system information block.
Each segment consists of a header and a data field. The data field carries the encoded system information elements. The header contains the following parameters:
-	The number of segments in the system information block (SEG_COUNT). This parameter is only included in the header if the segment type is "First segment".
-	SIB type. The SIB type uniquely identifies the master information block, scheduling block or a system information block.
-	Segment index. This parameter is only included in the header if the segment type is "Subsequent segment" or "Last segment".
UTRAN may combine one or several segments of variable length in the same SYSTEM INFORMATION message. The following combinations are allowed:
1.	No segment;
2.	First segment;
3.	Subsequent segment;
4.	Last segment;
5.	Last segment + First segment;
6.	Last segment + one or several Complete;
7.	Last segment + one or several Complete + First segment;
8.	One or several Complete;
9.	One or several Complete + First segment;
10.	One Complete of size 215 to 226;
11.	Last segment of size 215 to 222.
The "No segment" combination is used when there is no master information block, scheduling block or system information block scheduled for a specific BCH transport block.
UEs are not required to support the reception of multiple occurrences of the same system information block type within one SYSTEM INFORMATION message.
NOTE:	Since the SIB type is the same for each occurrence of the system information block, the UE does not know the order in which the occurrences, scheduled for this SYSTEM INFORMATION message, appear. Therefore, the UE is unable to determine which scheduling information, e.g., value tag relates to which occurrence of the system information block.
8.1.1.1.4	Re-assembly of segments
The RRC layer in the UE shall perform re-assembly of segments. All segments belonging to the same master information block, scheduling block or system information block shall be assembled in ascending order with respect to the segment index. When all segments of the master information block, scheduling block or a system information block have been received, the UE shall perform decoding of the complete master information block, scheduling block or system information block. For System Information Block types 15.2, 15.3 and 16, which may have multiple occurrences, each occurrence shall be re-assembled independently.
The UE shall discard system information blocks of which segments were missing, of which segments were received out of sequence and/or for which duplicate segments were received. The only valid sequence is an ascending one with the sequence starting with the First Segment of the associated System Information Block.
If the UE receives a Subsequent segment or Last segment where the index in IE "Segment index" is equal to or larger than the number of segments stated in IE "SEG_COUNT" in the scheduling information for that scheduling block or system information block:
1>	the UE may:
2>	read all the segments to create a system information block as defined by the scheduling information read by the UE;
2>	store the content of the system information block with a value tag set to the value NULL; and
2>	consider the content of the scheduling block or system information block as valid:
3>	until it receives the same type of scheduling block or system information block in a position according to its scheduling information; or
3>	at most for 6 hours after reception.
1>	and the UE shall:
2>	re-read scheduling information for that scheduling block or system information block.
If the UE receives a Subsequent segment or Last segment where the index in IE "Segment index" is equal to or larger than the number of segments stated in IE "SEG_COUNT" in the First segment, the UE shall
1>	discard all segments for that master information block, scheduling block or system information block; and
1>	re-read the scheduling information for that system information block;
1>	then re-read all segments for that system information block.
8.1.1.1.5	Scheduling of system information
Scheduling of system information blocks is performed by the RRC layer in UTRAN. If segmentation is used, it should be possible to schedule each segment separately.
To allow the mixing of system information blocks with short repetition period and system information blocks with segmentation over many frames, UTRAN may multiplex segments from different system information blocks. Multiplexing and de-multiplexing is performed by the RRC layer.
The scheduling of each system information block broadcast on a BCH transport channel is defined by the following parameters:
-	the number of segments (SEG_COUNT);
-	the repetition period (SIB_REP). The same value applies to all segments;
-	the position (phase) of the first segment within one cycle of the Cell System Frame Number (SIB_POS(0)). Since system information blocks are repeated with period SIB_REP, the value of SIB_POS(i), i = 0, 1, 2, … SEG_COUNT-1 must be less than SIB_REP for all segments;
-	the offset of the subsequent segments in ascending index order (SIB_OFF(i), i = 1, 2, … SEG_COUNT-1)	
The position of the subsequent segments is calculated using the following: SIB_POS(i) = SIB_POS(i-1) + SIB_OFF(i).
The scheduling is based on the Cell System Frame Number (SFN). The SFN of a frame at which a particular segment, i, with i = 0, 1, 2, … SEG_COUNT-1 of a system information block occurs, fulfils the following relation:
	SFN mod SIB_REP = SIB_POS(i)
In FDD and TDD the scheduling of the master information block is fixed as defined in table 8.1.1. For TDD, UTRAN may apply one of the values allowed for the master information block's repetition period. The value that UTRAN is using in TDD is not signalled; UEs have to determine it by trial and error.
8.1.1.2	Initiation
The system information is continuously broadcast on a regular basis in accordance with the scheduling defined for each system information block.
8.1.1.3	Reception of SYSTEM INFORMATION messages by the UE
The UE shall read SYSTEM INFORMATION messages broadcast on a BCH transport channel in idle mode and in the connected mode in states CELL_FACH, CELL_PCH, URA_PCH and CELL_DCH (TDD only). In addition, UEs in FDD mode which support simultaneous reception of one SCCPCH and one DPCH shall read system information on a FACH transport channel when in CELL_DCH state.
In idle mode and connected mode different combinations of system information blocks are valid. The UE shall acquire the system information blocks that are needed according to table 8.1.1.
The UE may store system information blocks with cell, PLMN or Equivalent PLMN area scope (including their value tag if applicable) for different cells and different PLMNs, to be used if the UE returns to these cells.
The UE shall consider all stored system information blocks as invalid after it has been switched off. Some information obtained from system information may be stored by the UE or in the USIM for use in a stored information cell selection.
When selecting a new cell the UE shall consider all current system information blocks with area scope cell to be invalid. If the UE has stored valid system information blocks for the newly selected cell, the UE may set those as current system information blocks.
After selecting a new cell and this cell broadcasts an IE "PLMN Identity" in the MIB which is different from the IE "PLMN Identity" broadcast in the MIB in the previously selected cell, the UE shall consider all current system information blocks with area scope PLMN to be invalid. If the UE has previously stored valid system information blocks for the selected cell of the new PLMN, the UE may set those as current system information blocks.
When NAS informs AS about a new selected PLMN, the UE shall consider all stored system information blocks with area scope Equivalent PLMN to be invalid.
8.1.1.4	Void

8.1.1.5	Actions upon reception of the Master Information Block and Scheduling Block(s)
When selecting a new cell, the UE shall read the master information block. The UE may use the pre-defined scheduling information to locate the master information block in the cell.
Upon reception of the master information block, the UE shall:
1>	if the IE "Multiple PLMN List" is not present in the Master Information Block:
2>	consider the IE "PLMN identity" in the Master Information Block as the PLMN identity of the cell.
1>	else:
2>	consider the PLMN identities in the IE "Multiple PLMN List" as the PLMN identities of the cell;
2>	when reading the "Multiple PLMN List", read all the PLMN identities in the list as follows:
3>	if the IE "MIB PLMN Identity" is set to TRUE:
4>	read the "PLMN identity" IE in the MIB and consider it as a part of the "Multiple PLMN List".
3>	if the IE "MIB PLMN Identity" is set to FALSE:
4>	not consider the "PLMN identity" IE in the MIB as a part of the "Multiple PLMN List";
4>	not consider the IE "PLMN identity" in the MIB as a PLMN identity of the cell;
4>	not forward the PLMN in the IE "PLMN identity" of the MIB to upper layers.
3>	if the MCC is not present when reading a IE "PLMN identity with Optional MCC" in the IE "Multiple PLMN List":
4>	set the MCC of this PLMN identity equal to the MCC of the closest preceding "PLMN identity with Optional MCC" in the "Multiple PLMN List" that includes an MCC;
4>	or, if no such "PLMN identity with Optional MCC" exists, the UE shall set the MCC of this PLMN identity to the MCC of the "PLMN identity" IE in the Master Information Block irrespective of the value of the IE "MIB PLMN Identity".
1>	if the UE is operating in "ANSI-41 mode" and the IE "PLMN Type" has the value "ANSI-41" or "GSM-MAP and ANSI-41":
2>	store the ANSI-41 Information elements contained in the master information block and perform initial process for ANSI-41.
1>	compare the value tag in the master information block with the value tag stored for this cell and this PLMN in the variable VALUE_TAG;
1>	if the value tags differ, or if no IEs for the master information block are stored:
2>	store the value tag into the variable VALUE_TAG for the master information block;
2>	read and store scheduling information included in the master information block.
1>	if the value tags are the same the UE may use stored system information blocks and scheduling blocks using value tag that were stored for this cell and this PLMN as valid system information.
For all system information blocks or scheduling blocks that are supported by the UE referenced in the master information block or the scheduling blocks, the UE shall perform the following actions:
1>	for all system information blocks with area scope "PLMN" or "Equivalent PLMN" that use value tags:
2>	compare the value tag read in scheduling information for that system information block with the value stored within the variable VALUE_TAG for that system information block;
2>	if the value tags differ, or if no IEs for the corresponding system information block are stored:
3>	store the value tag read in scheduling information for that system information block into the variable VALUE_TAG;
3>	read and store the IEs of that system information block.
2>	if the value tags are the same the UE may use stored system information blocks using value tag that were stored in this PLMN as valid system information.
1>	for all system information blocks or scheduling blocks with area scope cell that use value tags:
2>	compare the value tag read in scheduling information for that system information block or scheduling block with the value stored within the variable VALUE_TAG for that system information block or scheduling block;
2>	if the value tags differ, or if no IEs for the corresponding system information block or scheduling block are stored:
3>	store the value tag read in scheduling information for that system information block or scheduling block into the variable VALUE_TAG;
3>	read and store the IEs of that system information block or scheduling block.
2>	if the value tags are the same the UE may use stored system information blocks using value tags that were stored for this cell and this PLMN as valid system information.
1>	for system information blocks which may have multiple occurrences:
2>	compare the value tag and the configuration or multiple occurrence identity for the occurrence of the system information blocks read in scheduling information with the value tag and configuration or multiple occurrence identity stored within the variable VALUE_TAG:
3>	if the value tags differ, or if no IEs from the occurrence with that configuration or multiple occurrence identity of the system information block are stored:
4>	store the value tag read in scheduling information for that system information block and the occurrence with that configuration or multiple occurrence identity into the variable VALUE_TAG;
4>	read and store the IEs of that system information block.
3>	if the value tags and the configuration or multiple occurrence identity are identical to those stored, the UE may use stored occurrences of system information blocks that were stored for this cell and this PLMN as valid system information.
For system information blocks, not supported by the UE, but referenced either in the master information block or in the scheduling blocks, the UE may:
1>	skip reading this system information block;
1>	skip monitoring changes to this system information block.
If the UE:
1>	receives a scheduling block at a position different from its position according to the scheduling information for the scheduling block; or
1>	receives a scheduling block for which scheduling information has not been received:
the UE may:
1>	store the content of the scheduling block with a value tag set to the value NULL; and
1>	consider the content of the scheduling block as valid until it receives the same type of scheduling block in a position according to its scheduling information or at most for 6 hours after reception.
If the UE does not find a scheduling block in a position where it should be according to its scheduling information, but a transport block with correct CRC was found at that position, the UE shall:
1>	read the scheduling information for this scheduling block.
If the UE does not find the master information block in a position fulfilling:
	SFN mod 32 = 0
but a transport block with correct CRC was found at that position), the UE shall:
1>	consider the master information block as not found; and
1>	consider the cell to be barred according to [4]; and
1>	consider the barred cell as using the value "allowed" in the IE "Intra-frequency cell re-selection indicator", and the maximum value in the IE "Tbarred".
NOTE:	This permits a different repetition for the MIB in later versions for FDD. In TDD it allows for a variable SIB_REP in this and future releases.
If system information block type 1 is not scheduled on BCH, and system information block type 13 is not scheduled on BCH, the UE shall:
1>	consider the cell to be barred according to [4]; and
1>	consider the barred cell as using the value "allowed" in the IE "Intra-frequency cell re-selection indicator", and the maximum value in the IE "Tbarred".
If the UE only supports GSM-MAP but finds a cell that broadcasts System Information Block type 13 but not System Information Block type 1, the UE shall:
1>	consider the cell barred.
If:
-	system information block type 1 is not scheduled on BCH; and
-	the UE is operating in "GSM-MAP mode"; and
-	the IE "PLMN type" in the Master Information Block has the value "GSM-MAP" or "GSM-MAP and ANSI-41":
the UE shall:
1>	indicate to upper layers that no CN system information is available.
If in idle mode and System Information Block type 3 is not scheduled on BCH, the UE shall:
1>	consider the cell to be barred according to [4]; and
1>	consider the barred cell as using the value "allowed" in the IE "Intra-frequency cell re-selection indicator", and the maximum value in the IE "Tbarred".
If in connected mode and System Information Block type 3 is not scheduled on BCH, and System Information Block type 4 is not scheduled on BCH, the UE shall:
1>	consider the cell to be barred according to [4]; and
1>	consider the barred cell as using the value "allowed" in the IE "Intra-frequency cell re-selection indicator", and the maximum value in the IE "Tbarred".

8.1.1.6	Actions upon reception of system information blocks
The UE may use the scheduling information included within the master information block and the scheduling blocks to locate each system information block to be acquired.
The UE should only expect one occurrence of the scheduling information for a system information block in the master information block and any of the scheduling blocks except for System Information Block type 16, System Information Block type 15.2 and System Information Block type 15.3, which may have multiple occurrences. However, to enable future introduction of new system information blocks, the UE shall also be able to receive system information blocks other than the ones indicated within the scheduling information. The UE may ignore contents of such system information block.
If the UE:
1>	receives a system information block in a position according to the scheduling information for the system information block; and
1>	this system information block uses a value tag; or
1>	this system information block uses a value tag and configuration or multiple occurrence identity:
the UE shall:
1>	store the content of the system information block together with the value of its value tag or the values of configuration and multiple occurrence identity and the associated value tag in the scheduling information for the system information block; and
1>	consider the content of the system information block valid until, if used, the value tag in the scheduling information for the system information block is changed or at most for 6 hours after reception.
If the UE:
1>	receives a system information block in a position according to the scheduling information for the system information block; and
1>	this system information block does not use a value tag according to the system information block type:
the UE shall:
1>	store the content of the system information block; and
1>	start an expiration timer using a value as defined in Table 8.1.1 for that system information block type; and
1>	consider the content of the system information block valid until, the expiration timer expires.
If the UE:
1>	receives a system information block at a position different from its position according to the scheduling information for the system information block; or
1>	receives a system information block for which scheduling information has not been received; and
1>	this system information block uses a value tag:
the UE may:
1>	store the content of the system information block with a value tag set to the value NULL; and
1>	consider the content of the system information block as valid until it receives the same type of system information block in a position according to its scheduling information or at most for 6 hours after reception.
If the UE:
1>	receives a system information block with multiple occurrences at a position different from its position according to the scheduling information for the system information block; or
1>	receives a system information block with multiple occurrences for which scheduling information has not been received; and
1>	this system information block uses a value tag and configuration or multiple occurrence identity:
the UE shall:
1>	ignore this information.
If the UE does not find a system information block in a position where it should be according to its scheduling information, but a transport block with correct CRC was found at that position, the UE shall read the scheduling information for this system information block.
The UE shall act upon all received information elements as specified in subclause 8.6 unless specified otherwise in the following subclauses.

8.1.1.6.15.2	System Information Block type 15.2
For System Information Block type 15.2 multiple occurrences may be used; one occurrence for one satellite. To identify the different occurrences, the scheduling information for System Information Block type 15.2 includes IE "SIB occurrence identity and value tag". The UE should store all the relevant IEs included in this system information block in variable UE_POSITIONING_GPS_DATA. The UE shall:
1>	compare for each occurrence the value tag of the stored occurrence, if any, with the occurrence value tag included in the IE "SIB occurrence identity and value tag" for the occurrence of the System Information Block with the same occurrence identity;

8.1.1.6.16	System Information Block type 16
For System Information Block type 16 multiple occurrences may be used; one occurrence for each predefined configuration. To identify the different predefined configurations, the scheduling information for System Information Block type 16 includes IE "Predefined configuration identity and value tag".
The UE should store all relevant IEs included in this system information block. The UE shall:
1>	compare for each predefined configuration the value tag of the stored predefined configuration with the preconfiguration value tag included in the IE "Predefined configuration identity and value tag" for the occurrence of the System Information Block with the same predefined configuration identity;
1>	in case the UE has no predefined configuration stored with the same identity:

1>	if the IE "PDSCH system information" and/or the IE "PUSCH system information" is included, store each of the configurations given there with the associated identity given in the IE "PDSCH Identity" and/or "PUSCH Identity" respectively. This information shall become invalid after the time specified by the repetition period (SIB_REP) for this system information block.
If in idle mode, the UE shall not use the values of the IEs in this system information block.
8.1.1.6.18	System Information Block type 18
If the System Information Block type 18 is present, a UE shall obtain knowledge of the PLMN identity of the neighbour cells to be considered for cell reselection, and shall behave as specified in this subclause and in subclause 8.5.14a.
The UE should store all the relevant IEs included in this system information block.
A UE in idle mode shall act according to the following rules:
1>	if System Information Block type 11bis is scheduled on BCH; and the IE "Idle mode PLMN identities for SIB 11bis" is present: 
2>	any PLMN list of a given type (IEs "PLMNs of intra-frequency cells list", "PLMNs of inter-frequency cells list", "PLMNs of inter-RAT cell lists") included in the IE "Idle mode PLMN identities for SIB 11bis" is paired with the list of cells of the same type derived from System Information Block type 11 and System Information Block type 11bis.
1>	else:
2>	any PLMN list of a given type (IEs "PLMNs of intra-frequency cells list", "PLMNs of inter-frequency cells list", "PLMNs of inter-RAT cell lists") included in the IE "Idle mode PLMN identities" is paired with the list of cells of the same type derived from System Information Block type 11 and System Information Block type 11bis if scheduled on BCH.
1>	the PLMN identity located at a given rank in the PLMN list is that of the cell with the same ranking in the paired list of cells, the cells being considered in the increasing order of their associated identities ("Intra-frequency cell id", "Inter-frequency cell id", "Inter-RAT cell id");
1>	if no identity is indicated for the first PLMN in a list, the UE shall assume that the neighbouring cell broadcasts the same PLMN configuration (i.e. IE "PLMN Identity" and IE "Multiple PLMN List") as the current cell;
1>	if no identity is indicated for another entry in the list, the UE shall assume that the neighbouring cell broadcasts the same PLMN configuration (i.e. IE "PLMN Identity" and IE "Multiple PLMN List") as the previous cell in the list;
1>	if the number of identities in a PLMN list exceeds the number of neighbour cells in the paired list (if any), the extra PLMN identities are considered as unnecessary and ignored;
1>	if the number of identities in a PLMN list (if any) is lower than the number of neighbour cells in the paired list, the missing PLMN identities are replaced by the PLMN configuration for the last cell in the list.
A UE in connected mode shall act in the same manner as a UE in idle mode with the following modifications:
1>	if System Information Block type 11bis is scheduled on BCH:
2>	the PLMN lists to be considered are the ones included, when present, in the IE "Connected mode PLMN identities for SIB 11bis";
2>	otherwise, the UE shall use, in place of any missing list, when present, the corresponding one in the IE "Idle mode PLMN identities for SIB11bis";
2>	otherwise, the UE shall use, in place of any missing list, when present, the corresponding one in the IE "Connected mode PLMN identities";
2>	otherwise, the UE shall use, in place of any missing list, the corresponding one in the IE "Idle mode PLMN identities".
1>	else:
2>	the PLMN lists to be considered are the ones included, when present, in the IE "Connected mode PLMN identities";
2>	otherwise, the UE shall use, in place of any missing list, the corresponding one in the IE "Idle mode PLMN identities".
1>	the paired lists of cells are the ones derived from System Information Block type 11, and System Information Block type 11bis if scheduled on BCH, and System Information Block type 12 if present.
8.1.1.7	Modification of system information
For System Information Block type 15.2, 15.3 and 16 that may have multiple occurrences, the UE shall handle each occurrence independently as specified in the previous; that is each occurrence is handled as a separate system information block.
NOTE:	It should be noted that for the proper operation of the BCCH Modification Information sent on a PCH, the System Information should not be changed more frequently than can be accommodated by mobile stations operating at the maximum DRX cycle length supported by the UTRAN.
8.1.1.7.1	Modification of system information blocks using a value tag
Upon modifications of system information blocks using value tags, UTRAN should notify the new value tag for the master information block in the IE "BCCH modification info", transmitted in the following way:
1>	to reach UEs in idle mode, CELL_PCH state and URA_PCH state, the IE "BCCH modification info" is contained in a PAGING TYPE 1 message transmitted on the PCCH in all paging occasions in the cell;
1>	to reach UEs in CELL_FACH state or TDD UEs in CELL_DCH with S-CCPCH assigned, the IE "BCCH modification info" is contained in a SYSTEM INFORMATION CHANGE INDICATION message transmitted on the BCCH mapped on at least one FACH on every Secondary CCPCH in the cell.
Upon reception of a PAGING TYPE 1 message or a SYSTEM INFORMATION CHANGE INDICATION message containing the IE "BCCH modification info" containing the IE "MIB value tag" but not containing the IE "BCCH modification time", the UE shall perform actions as specified in subclause 8.1.1.7.3.
If the IE "BCCH modification time" is included the UE shall perform actions as specified in subclause 8.1.1.7.2.
8.1.1.7.2	Synchronised modification of system information blocks
For modification of some system information elements, e.g. reconfiguration of the channels, it is important for the UE to know exactly when a change occurs. In such cases, the UTRAN should notify the SFN when the change will occur as well as the new value tag for the master information block in the IE "BCCH modification info" transmitted in the following way:
1>	To reach UEs in idle mode, CELL_PCH state and URA_PCH state, the IE "BCCH modification info" is contained in a PAGING TYPE 1 message transmitted on the PCCH in all paging occasions in the cell;
1>	To reach UEs in CELL_FACH state, the IE "BCCH modification info" is contained in a SYSTEM INFORMATION CHANGE INDICATION message transmitted on the BCCH mapped on at least one FACH on every Secondary CCPCH in the cell.
Upon reception of a PAGING TYPE 1 message or a SYSTEM INFORMATION CHANGE INDICATION message containing the IE "BCCH modification info" containing the IE "MIB value tag" and containing the IE "BCCH modification time", the UE shall:
1>	perform the actions as specified in subclause 8.1.1.7.3 at the time, indicated in the IE "BCCH Modification Info".
8.1.1.7.3	Actions upon system information change
The UE shall:
1>	compare the value of IE "MIB value tag" in the IE "BCCH modification info" with the value tag stored for the master information block in variable VALUE_TAG.
1>	if the value tags differ:
2>	read the master information block on BCH;
2>	if the value tag of the master information block in the system information is the same as the value in IE "MIB value tag" in "BCCH modification info" but different from the value tag stored in the variable VALUE_TAG:
3>	perform actions as specified in subclause 8.1.1.5.
2>	if the value tag of the master information block in the system information is the same as the value tag stored in the variable VALUE_TAG:
3>	for the next occurrence of the master information block:
4>	perform actions as specified in subclause 8.1.1.7.3 again.
2>	if the value tag of the master information block in the system information is different from the value tag stored in the variable VALUE_TAG, and is different from the value in IE "MIB value tag" in "BCCH modification info":
3>	perform actions as specified in subclause 8.1.1.5;
3>	if (VTCI-VTMIB) mod 8 < 4, where VTCI is the value tag in the IE "MIB value tag" in "BCCH modification info" and VTMIB is the value tag of the master information block in the system information:
4>	for the next occurrence of the master information block:
5>	perform actions as specified in subclause 8.1.1.7.3 again.
8.1.1.7.4	Actions upon expiry of a system information expiry timer
When the expiry timer of a system information block not using a value tag expires
the UE shall:
1>	consider the content of the system information block invalid;
1>	re-acquire the system information block again before the content can be used;
 In FDD for system information blocks other than System Information Block type 7, or in states other than CELL_FACH, or in TDD for system information blocks other than System Information Block type 14, or in states other than CELL_FACH or CELL_DCH the UE may:
1>	postpone reading the system information block until the content is needed.
In FDD for System Information Block type 7, while in state CELL_FACH, and in TDD for System Information Block type 14, while in state CELL_FACH or CELL DCH the UE shall always keep an up to date version of the relevant IEs, unless this is not possible because system information can not be received due to bad radio conditions.
8.1.2	Paging

Figure 8.1.2-1: Paging
8.1.2.1	General
This procedure is used to transmit paging information to selected UEs in idle mode, CELL_PCH or URA_PCH state using the paging control channel (PCCH). Upper layers in the network may request paging, to e.g. establish a signalling connection. UTRAN may initiate paging for UEs in CELL_PCH or URA_PCH state to trigger a cell update procedure. In addition, UTRAN may initiate paging for UEs in idle mode, CELL_PCH and URA_PCH state to trigger reading of updated system information. UTRAN may also initiate paging for UEs in CELL_PCH and URA_PCH state to release the RRC connection.
8.1.2.2	Initiation
UTRAN initiates the paging procedure by transmitting a PAGING TYPE 1 message on an appropriate paging occasion on the PCCH.
UTRAN may repeat transmission of a PAGING TYPE 1 message to a UE in several paging occasions to increase the probability of proper reception of a page.
UTRAN may page several UEs in the same paging occasion by including one IE "Paging record" for each UE in the PAGING TYPE 1 message.
For CN originated paging, UTRAN should set the IE "Paging cause" to the cause for paging received from upper layers. If no cause for paging is received from upper layers, UTRAN should set the value "Terminating – cause unknown".
UTRAN may also indicate that system information has been updated, by including the value tag of the master information block in the IE "BCCH modification info" in the PAGING TYPE 1 message. In this case, UTRAN may omit the IEs "Paging record".
8.1.2.3	Reception of a PAGING TYPE 1 message by the UE
A UE in idle mode, CELL_PCH state or URA_PCH state shall receive the paging information for all its monitored paging occasions. For a UE in idle mode, the paging occasions are specified in [4] and depend on the IE "CN domain specific DRX cycle length coefficient", as specified in subclause 8.6.3.1a. For a UE in CELL_PCH state or URA_PCH state, the paging occasions depend also on the IE "UTRAN DRX cycle length coefficient" and the IE "RRC State Indicator", as specified in subclauses 8.6.3.2 and 8.6.3.3 respectively.
When the UE receives a PAGING TYPE 1 message, it shall perform the actions as specified below.
If the UE is in idle mode, for each occurrence of the IE "Paging record" included in the message the UE shall:
1>	if the IE "Used paging identity" is a CN identity:
2>	compare the IE "UE identity" with all of its allocated CN UE identities:
2>	if one match is found:
3>	indicate reception of paging; and
3>	forward the IE "CN domain identity", the IE "UE identity" and the IE "Paging cause" to the upper layers.
1>	otherwise:
2>	ignore that paging record.
If the UE is in connected mode, for each occurrence of the IE "Paging record" included in the message the UE shall:
1>	if the IE "Used paging identity" is a UTRAN single UE identity and if this U-RNTI is the same as the U-RNTI allocated to the UE stored in the UE variable U_RNTI:
2>	if the optional IE "CN originated page to connected mode UE" is included:
3>	indicate reception of paging; and
3>	forward the IE "CN domain identity", the IE "Paging cause" and the IE "Paging record type identifier" to the upper layers.
2>	if the IE "Release indicator" in the IE "RRC connection release information" has the value "Release":
3>	release all its radio resources;
3>	indicate the release of the established signalling connections (as stored in the variable ESTABLISHED_SIGNALLING_CONNECTIONS) and established radio access bearers (as stored in the variable ESTABLISHED_RABS) to the upper layers;
3>	clear the variable ESTABLISHED_SIGNALLING_CONNECTIONS;
3>	clear the variable ESTABLISHED_RABS;
3>	pass the value of the IE "Release cause" received in the IE "Release information" to upper layers;
3>	enter idle mode;
3>	perform the actions specified in subclause 8.5.2 when entering idle mode;
3>	and the procedure ends.
2>	otherwise:
3>	perform a cell update procedure with cause "paging response" as specified in subclause 8.3.1.2.
2>	ignore any other remaining IE "Paging record" that may be present in the message.
1>	if the IE "Used paging identity" is a UTRAN group identity and there is a group identity match according to subclause 8.6.3.13:
2>	if the IE "Release indicator" in the IE "RRC connection release information" has the value "Release":
3>	release all its radio resources;
3>	indicate the release of the established signalling connections (as stored in the variable ESTABLISHED_SIGNALLING_CONNECTIONS) and established radio access bearers (as stored in the variable ESTABLISHED_RABS) to the upper layers;
3>	clear the variable ESTABLISHED_SIGNALLING_CONNECTIONS;
3>	clear the variable ESTABLISHED_RABS;
3>	pass the value of the IE "Release cause" received in the IE “Release information” to upper layers;
3>	enter idle mode;
3>	perform the actions specified in subclause 8.5.2 when entering idle mode;
3>	and the procedure ends.
2>	otherwise:
3>	perform a cell update procedure with cause "paging response" as specified in subclause 8.3.1.2.
2>	ignore any other remaining IE "Paging record" that may be present in the message.
1>	otherwise:
2>	ignore that paging record.
If the IE "BCCH modification info" is included, any UE in idle mode, CELL_PCH or URA_PCH state shall perform the actions as specified in subclause 8.1.1 in addition to any actions caused by the IE "Paging record" occurrences in the message as specified above.
8.1.3	RRC connection establishment

Figure 8.1.3-2: RRC Connection Establishment, network rejects RRC connection
8.1.3.1	General
The purpose of this procedure is to establish an RRC connection.
8.1.3.2	Initiation
The UE shall initiate the procedure when upper layers in the UE requests the establishment of a signalling connection and the UE is in idle mode (no RRC connection exists), as specified in subclause 8.1.8.
Upon initiation of the procedure, the UE shall:
1>	set the variable PROTOCOL_ERROR_INDICATOR to FALSE;
1>	if the USIM is present:
2>	set the value of "THRESHOLD" in the variable "START_THRESHOLD" to the 20 MSBs of the value stored in the USIM [50] for the maximum value of START for each CN Domain.
1>	if the SIM is present:
2>	set the value of "THRESHOLD" in the variable "START_THRESHOLD" to the default value in [40] for each CN Domain.

1>	submit the RRC CONNECTION REQUEST message for transmission on the uplink CCCH;
1>	set counter V300 to 1; and
1>	if the variable ESTABLISHMENT_CAUSE is set to "MBMS reception":
2>	when the MAC layer indicates success or failure to transmit the message:
3>	if the MAC layer indicates failure:
4>	enter idle mode;
4>	consider the procedure to be unsuccessful;
4>	perform other actions when entering idle mode from connected mode as specified in subclause 8.5.2;
4>	the procedure ends.
3>	else:
4>	start timer T318;
4>	apply value 0 for counter N300 regardless of the value included in IE "UE Timers and Constants in idle mode".
1>	otherwise:
2>	start timer T300 when the MAC layer indicates success or failure to transmit the message.
1>	select a Secondary CCPCH according to [4];
1>	start receiving all FACH transport channels mapped on the selected Secondary CCPCH.
8.1.3.3	RRC CONNECTION REQUEST message contents to set
The UE shall, in the transmitted RRC CONNECTION REQUEST message:
1>	set the IE "Establishment cause" to the value of the variable ESTABLISHMENT_CAUSE;
1>	set the IE "Initial UE identity" to the value of the variable INITIAL_UE_IDENTITY;
1>	set the IE "Protocol error indicator" to the value of the variable PROTOCOL_ERROR_INDICATOR; and
1>	include the IE "Predefined configuration status information" and set this IE to true if  the UE has all pre- configurations stored with the same value tag as broadcast in the cell in which the RRC connection establishment is initiated.
1>	if the UE is attempting to establish the signalling connection to PS-domain:
2> include the IE "Domain Indicator" and set it to "PS domain".
1> else if the UE is attempting to establish the signalling connection to CS domain:
2>	include the IE "Domain Indicator" and set it to "CS domain".
2>	if the value of the variable ESTABLISHMENT_CAUSE is set to "Originating Conversational Call" or "Terminating Conversational Call" or "Emergency Call":
3>	set the value of the IE "Call type" to "speech", "video" or "other" according to the call being initiated.
1>	if the UE only supports HS-DSCH but not E-DCH:
2>	include the IE "UE capability indication" and set it to the "HS-DSCH" value.
1>	if the UE supports HS-DSCH and E-DCH:
2>	include the IE "UE capability indication" and set it to the "HS-DSCH+E-DCH" value. 
1>	if, according to [4], the High-mobility state is applicable and it has been detected by the UE:
2>	include the IE "UE Mobility State Indicator" and set it to the "High-MobilityDetected" value.
1>	if the UE performs connection establishment for MBMS ptp radio bearer request as specified in subclause 8.6.9.6; and
1>	if one or more of the MBMS services for which the UE initiates the ptp radio bearer request concerns an MBMS Selected Service:
2>	for each MBMS Selected Service that is indicated on MCCH and for which the UE initiates the ptp radio bearer request:
3>	include the IE "MBMS Selected Service ID" within the IE "MBMS Selected Services Short" and set it to a value in accordance with subclause 8.6.9.8.
1>	otherwise if the UE performs connection establishment for MBMS counting as specified in subclause 8.7.4; and
1>	if one or more of the MBMS services for which the UE initiates the counting response concerns an MBMS Selected Service:
2>	for each MBMS Selected Service that is indicated on MCCH and for which the UE initiates the counting response:
3>	include the IE "MBMS Selected Service ID" within the IE "MBMS Selected Services Short" and set it to a value in accordance with subclause 8.6.9.8.

The UE shall not include the IE "UE Specific Behaviour Information 1 idle".
8.1.3.4	Reception of an RRC CONNECTION REQUEST message by the UTRAN
Upon receiving an RRC CONNECTION REQUEST message, UTRAN should either:
1>	accept the request and use a predefined or default radio configuration, in which case it should:
2> include the following information in the RRC CONNECTION SETUP message:
3> the IE "Predefined configuration identity", to indicate which pre-defined configuration of RB and, transport channel parameters shall be used; or
3>	the IE "Default configuration mode" and IE "Default configuration identity", to indicate which default configuration of RB and transport channel parameters shall be used;
3>	PhyCH information elements.
2> submit the RRC CONNECTION SETUP message to the lower layers for transmission on the downlink CCCH.
NOTE 1:	UTRAN should only apply a predefined radio configuration in case it orders the UE to enter CELL_DCH. This is because the predefined configuration information included in System Information Block 16 mandatorily includes information only required in CELL_DCH state.
1>	accept the request without using a predefined or default radio configuration, in which case it should:
2>	include in the RRC CONNECTION SETUP message the complete set of RB, TrCH and PhyCH information elements to be used;
2>	submit the RRC CONNECTION SETUP message to the lower layers for transmission on the downlink CCCH;
NOTE 2:	In R'99, the RRC CONNECTION SETUP message always includes the IEs "Added or Reconfigured TrCH information list", both for uplink and downlink transport channels, even if UTRAN orders the UE to move to CELL_FACH and hence need not configure any transport channels. In these cases, UTRAN may include a configuration that adds little to the encoded message size e.g. a DCH with a single zero size transport format. At a later stage, UTRAN may either remove or reconfigure this configuration.
1>	submit an RRC CONNECTION REJECT message on the downlink CCCH. In the RRC CONNECTION REJECT message, the UTRAN may direct the UE to another UTRA carrier or to another system. After the RRC CONNECTION REJECT message has been sent, all context information for the UE may be deleted in UTRAN.

3>	apply the given Access Service Class when accessing the RACH;
3>	submit a new RRC CONNECTION REQUEST message to lower layers for transmission on the uplink CCCH;
3>	increment counter V300;
3>	restart timer T300 when the MAC layer indicates success or failure to transmit the message.
2>	if V300 is greater than N300:

3>	the procedure ends.
8.1.3.5a	Abortion of RRC connection establishment
If the UE has not yet entered UTRA RRC Connected mode and the RRC connection establishment is to be aborted as specified in subclause 8.1.8, the UE shall:
1>	consider the procedure to be unsuccessful;
1>	perform the actions when entering idle mode as specified in subclause 8.5.2.
The procedure ends.
8.1.3.6	Reception of an RRC CONNECTION SETUP message by the UE
The UE shall compare the value of the IE "Initial UE identity" in the received RRC CONNECTION SETUP message with the value of the variable INITIAL_UE_IDENTITY.
If the values are different, the UE shall:
1>	ignore the rest of the message.
If the values are identical, the UE shall:
2>	if IE "Specification mode" is set to "Preconfiguration" and IE "Preconfiguration mode" is set to "Predefined configuration":
3>	initiate the radio bearer and transport channel configuration in accordance with the predefined parameters identified by the IE "Predefined configuration identity" with the following exception;
4> ignore the IE "RB to setup list" and the IE "Re- establishment timer".
NOTE:	IE above IEs are mandatory to include in IE “Predefined RB configuration” that is included in System Information Block 16 but should be ignored since it is not possible to establish a RAB during RRC connection establishment.

8.1.4	RRC connection release

Figure 8.1.4-1: RRC Connection Release procedure on the DCCH

Figure 8.1.4-2: RRC Connection Release procedure on the CCCH
8.1.4.1	General
The purpose of this procedure is to release the RRC connection including all radio bearers and all signalling radio bearers between the UE and the UTRAN. By doing so, all established signalling connections will be released.
8.1.4.2	Initiation
When the UE is in state CELL_DCH or CELL_FACH, the UTRAN may at anytime initiate an RRC connection release by transmitting an RRC CONNECTION RELEASE message using UM RLC.
When UTRAN transmits an RRC CONNECTION RELEASE message the downlink DCCH should be used, if available. If the downlink DCCH is not available in UTRAN and the UE is in CELL_FACH state, the downlink CCCH may be used.
UTRAN may transmit several RRC CONNECTION RELEASE messages to increase the probability of proper reception of the message by the UE. In such a case, the RRC SN for these repeated messages should be the same. The number of repeated messages and the interval between the messages is a network option.
8.1.4.3	Reception of an RRC CONNECTION RELEASE message by the UE
The UE shall receive and act on an RRC CONNECTION RELEASE message in states CELL_DCH and CELL_FACH. Furthermore this procedure can interrupt any ongoing procedures with the UE in the above listed states.
When the UE receives the first RRC CONNECTION RELEASE message; and
1>	if the message is received on the CCCH, and IE "U-RNTI" is present and has the same value as the variable U_RNTI; or
1>	if the message is received on DCCH:
the UE shall perform the RRC connection release procedure as specified below.
When the UE receives the first RRC CONNECTION RELEASE message; and 
1>	if the message is received on the CCCH, the IE "UTRAN group identity" is present and there is a group identity match according to subclause 8.6.3.13:
the UE shall perform the RRC connection release procedure as specified below.
The UE shall:
1>	in state CELL_DCH:
2>	initialise the counter V308 to zero;
2>	set the IE "RRC transaction identifier" in the RRC CONNECTION RELEASE COMPLETE message to the value of "RRC transaction identifier" in the entry for the RRC CONNECTION RELEASE message in the table "Accepted transactions" in the variable TRANSACTIONS;
2>	submit an RRC CONNECTION RELEASE COMPLETE message to the lower layers for transmission using UM RLC on the DCCH to the UTRAN;
2>	if the IE "Rplmn information" is present:
3>	the UE may:
4>	store the IE on the ME together with the PLMN id for which it applies;
3>	the UE may then:
4>	utilise this information, typically indicating where a number of BCCH frequency ranges of a RAT may be expected to be found, during subsequent Rplmn selections of the indicated PLMN.
2>	if the IE "UE Mobility State Indicator" is present:
3>	consider the High-mobility state to have being detected when entering idle mode.
2>	start timer T308 when the RRC CONNECTION RELEASE COMPLETE message is sent on the radio interface.
1>	in state CELL_FACH:
2>	if the RRC CONNECTION RELEASE message was received on the DCCH:
3>	set the IE "RRC transaction identifier" in the RRC CONNECTION RELEASE COMPLETE message to	the value of "RRC transaction identifier" in the entry for the RRC CONNECTION RELEASE message in the table "Accepted transactions" in the variable TRANSACTIONS;
3>	submit an RRC CONNECTION RELEASE COMPLETE message to the lower layers for transmission using AM RLC on the DCCH to the UTRAN.
3>	when the successful transmission of the RRC CONNECTION RELEASE COMPLETE message has been confirmed by the lower layers:
4>	release all its radio resources; and
4>	indicate the release of the established signalling connections (as stored in the variable ESTABLISHED_SIGNALLING_CONNECTIONS) and established radio access bearers (as stored in the variable ESTABLISHED_RABS) to upper layers; and
4>	clear any entry for the RRC CONNECTION RELEASE message in the tables "Accepted transactions" and "Rejected transactions" in the variable TRANSACTIONS;
4>	clear the variable ESTABLISHED_SIGNALLING_CONNECTIONS;
4>	clear the variable ESTABLISHED_RABS;
4>	pass the value of the IE "Release cause" received in the RRC CONNECTION RELEASE message to upper layers;
4>	enter idle mode;
4>	perform the actions specified in subclause 8.5.2 when entering idle mode.
3>	and the procedure ends.
2>	if the RRC CONNECTION RELEASE message was received on the CCCH:
3>	release all its radio resources;
3>	indicate the release of the established signalling connections (as stored in the variable ESTABLISHED_SIGNALLING_CONNECTIONS) and established radio access bearers (as stored in the variable ESTABLISHED_RABS) to the upper layers;
3>	clear any entry for the RRC CONNECTION RELEASE message in the tables "Accepted transactions" and "Rejected transactions" in the variable TRANSACTIONS;
3>	clear the variable ESTABLISHED_SIGNALLING_CONNECTIONS;
3>	clear the variable ESTABLISHED_RABS;
3>	pass the value of the IE "Release cause" received in the RRC CONNECTION RELEASE message to upper layers;

8.1.8	Initial Direct transfer

Figure 8.1.8-1: Initial Direct transfer in the uplink, normal flow
8.1.8.1	General
The initial direct transfer procedure is used in the uplink to establish a signalling connection. It is also used to carry an initial upper layer (NAS) message over the radio interface.
8.1.8.2	Initiation of Initial direct transfer procedure in the UE
In the UE, the initial direct transfer procedure shall be initiated, when the upper layers request establishment of a signalling connection. This request also includes a request for the transfer of a NAS message.
Upon initiation of the initial direct transfer procedure the UE shall:
1>	set the variable ESTABLISHMENT_CAUSE to the cause for establishment indicated by upper layers.
Upon initiation of the initial direct transfer procedure when the UE is in idle mode, the UE shall:
1>	perform an RRC connection establishment procedure, according to subclause 8.1.3;
NOTE:	If an RRC connection establishment is ongoing, this procedure continues unchanged, i.e. it is not interrupted.
1>	if the RRC connection establishment procedure was not successful:
2>	if the establishment cause for the failed RRC connection establishment was set to "MBMS reception" and a different cause value is stored in the variable "ESTABLISHMENT_CAUSE":
3>	UE-AS (RRC) initiates a new RRC connection establishment procedure, using the establishment cause as contained in the variable ESTABLISHMENT_CAUSE.
2>	otherwise:
3>	indicate failure to establish the signalling connection to upper layers and end the procedure.
1>	when the RRC connection establishment procedure is completed successfully:
2>	continue with the initial direct transfer procedure as below.
Upon initiation of the initial direct transfer procedure when the UE is in CELL_PCH or URA_PCH state, the UE shall:
1>	perform a cell update procedure, according to subclause 8.3.1, using the cause "uplink data transmission";
1>	when the cell update procedure completed successfully:
2>	continue with the initial direct transfer procedure as below.
The UE shall, in the INITIAL DIRECT TRANSFER message:
1>	set the IE "NAS message" as received from upper layers; and
1>	set the IE "CN domain identity" as indicated by the upper layers; and
1>	set the IE "Intra Domain NAS Node Selector" as follows:
2>	derive the IE "Intra Domain NAS Node Selector" from TMSI/PMTSI, IMSI, or IMEI; and
2>	provide the coding of the IE "Intra Domain NAS Node Selector" according to the following priorities:
1.	derive the routing parameter for IDNNS from TMSI (CS domain) or PTMSI (PS domain) whenever a valid TMSI/PTMSI is available;
2.	base the routing parameter for IDNNS on IMSI when no valid TMSI/PTMSI is available;
3.	base the routing parameter for IDNNS on IMEI only if no (U)SIM is inserted in the UE.
1>	if the UE, on the existing RRC connection, has received a dedicated RRC message containing the IE "Primary PLMN Identity" in the IE "CN Information Info":
2>	set the IE "PLMN identity" in the INITIAL DIRECT TRANSFER message to the latest PLMN information received via dedicated RRC signalling. If NAS has indicated the PLMN towards which a signalling connection is requested, and this PLMN is not in agreement with the latest PLMN information received via dedicated RRC signalling, then the initial direct transfer procedure shall be aborted, and NAS shall be informed.
1>	if the UE, on the existing RRC connection, has not received a dedicated RRC message containing the IE "CN Information Info" , and if the IE "Multiple PLMN List" was broadcast in the cell where the current RRC connection was established:
2>	set the IE "PLMN identity" in the INITIAL DIRECT TRANSFER message to the PLMN chosen by higher layers [5, 25] amongst the PLMNs in the IE "Multiple PLMN List" broadcast in the cell where the RRC connection was established.
1>	if the IE "Activated service list" within variable MBMS_ACTIVATED_SERVICES includes one or more MBMS services with the IE "Service type" set to "Multicast" and;
1>	if the UE is in CELL_FACH state and the IE "CN domain identity" as indicated by the upper layers is set to "CS domain":
2>	if the value of the variable ESTABLISHMENT_CAUSE is set to "Originating Conversational Call" or "Terminating Conversational Call" or "Emergency Call":
3>	set the value of the IE "Call type" to "speech", "video" or "other" according to the call being initiated.
1>	if the IE "CN domain identity" as indicated by the upper layers is set to "CS domain" and;
1>	if the variable ESTABLISHED_SIGNALLING_CONNECTIONS does not include the CN domain identity 'PS domain':
2>	include the IE "MBMS joined information";
2>	include the IE "P-TMSI" within the IE "MBMS joined information" if a valid PTMSI is available.
1>	if the variable ESTABLISHMENT_CAUSE_ is initialised:
2>	set the IE "Establishment cause" to the value of the variable ESTABLISHMENT_CAUSE;
2>	clear the variable ESTABLISHMENT_CAUSE.
1>	calculate the START according to subclause 8.5.9 for the CN domain as set in the IE "CN Domain Identity"; and
1>	include the calculated START value for that CN domain in the IE "START".
The UE shall:
1>	transmit the INITIAL DIRECT TRANSFER message on the uplink DCCH using AM RLC on signalling radio bearer RB3;
1>	when the INITIAL DIRECT TRANSFER message has been submitted to lower layers for transmission:
2>	confirm the establishment of a signalling connection to upper layers; and
2>	add the signalling connection with the identity indicated by the IE "CN domain identity" in the variable ESTABLISHED_SIGNALLING_CONNECTIONS.
1>	when the successful delivery of the INITIAL DIRECT TRANSFER message has been confirmed by RLC:
2>	the procedure ends.
When not stated otherwise elsewhere, the UE may also initiate the initial direct transfer procedure when another procedure is ongoing, and in that case the state of the latter procedure shall not be affected.
A new signalling connection request may be received from upper layers during transition to idle mode. In those cases, from the time of the indication of release to upper layers until the UE has entered idle mode, any such upper layer request to establish a new signalling connection shall be queued. This request shall be processed after the UE has entered idle mode.
8.1.8.2a	RLC re-establishment or inter-RAT change
If a re-establishment of the transmitting side of the RLC entity on signalling radio bearer RB3 occurs before the successful delivery of the INITIAL DIRECT TRANSFER message has been confirmed by RLC, the UE shall:
1>	retransmit the INITIAL DIRECT TRANSFER message on the uplink DCCH using AM RLC on signalling radio bearer RB3.
If an Inter-RAT handover from UTRAN procedure occurs before the successful delivery of the INITIAL DIRECT TRANSFER message has been confirmed by RLC, for messages with the IE "CN domain identity" set to "CS domain", the UE shall:
1>	retransmit the NAS message as specified in subclause 8.3.7.4.
8.1.8.2ab	Inter-RAT handover from UTRAN to GERAN Iu mode
If an Inter-RAT handover from UTRAN to GERAN Iu mode occurs before the successful delivery of the INITIAL DIRECT TRANSFER message has been confirmed by RLC, for messages for all CN domains, the UE shall:
1>	retransmit the NAS message as specified in subclause 8.3.7.4.
8.1.8.2b	Abortion of signalling connection establishment
If the UE receives a request from upper layers to release (abort) the signalling connection for the CN domain for which the initial direct transfer procedure is ongoing, the UE shall:
1>	if the UE has not yet entered UTRA RRC connected mode:
2>	abort the RRC connection establishment procedure as specified in subclause 8.1.3;
the procedure ends.
8.1.8.3	Reception of INITIAL DIRECT TRANSFER message by the UTRAN
On reception of the INITIAL DIRECT TRANSFER message the NAS message should be routed using the IE "CN Domain Identity". UTRAN may also use the IE "Intra Domain NAS Node Selector" and the IE "PLMN identity" for routing among the CN nodes for the addressed CN domain.
If no signalling connection exists towards the chosen node, then a signalling connection is established.
When the UTRAN receives an INITIAL DIRECT TRANSFER message, it shall not affect the state of any other ongoing RRC procedures, when not stated otherwise elsewhere.
The UTRAN should:
1>	set the START value for the CN domain indicated in the IE "CN domain identity" to the value of the IE "START".
8.1.9	Downlink Direct transfer

Figure 8.1.9-1: Downlink Direct transfer, normal flow
8.1.9.1	General
The downlink direct transfer procedure is used in the downlink direction to carry upper layer (NAS) messages over the radio interface.
8.1.9.2	Initiation of downlink direct transfer procedure in the UTRAN
In the UTRAN, the direct transfer procedure is initiated when the upper layers request the transfer of a NAS message after the initial signalling connection is established. The UTRAN may also initiate the downlink direct transfer procedure when another RRC procedure is ongoing, and in that case the state of the latter procedure shall not be affected. The UTRAN shall transmit the DOWNLINK DIRECT TRANSFER message on the downlink DCCH using AM RLC on signalling radio bearer RB3 or signalling radio bearer RB4. The UTRAN should:
1>	if upper layers indicate "low priority" for this message:
2>	select signalling radio bearer RB4, if available. Specifically, for a GSM-MAP based CN, signalling radio bearer RB4 should, if available, be selected when "SAPI 3" is requested;
2>	select signalling radio bearer RB3 when signalling radio bearer RB4 is not available.
1>	if upper layers indicate "high priority" for this message:
2>	select signalling radio bearer RB3. Specifically, for a GSM-MAP based CN, signalling radio bearer RB3 should be selected when "SAPI 0" is requested.
The UTRAN sets the IE "CN Domain Identity" to indicate, which CN domain the NAS message is originated from.
8.1.9.3	Reception of a DOWNLINK DIRECT TRANSFER message by the UE
Upon reception of the DOWNLINK DIRECT TRANSFER message, the UE RRC shall, using the IE "CN Domain Identity", route the contents of the IE "NAS message" and the value of the IE"CN Domain Identity" to upper layers.
The UE shall clear the entry for the DOWNLINK DIRECT TRANSFER message in the table "Accepted transactions" in the variable TRANSACTIONS.
When the UE receives a DOWNLINK DIRECT TRANSFER message, it shall not affect the state of any other ongoing RRC procedures when not stated otherwise elsewhere.
8.1.9.3a	No signalling connection exists
If the UE receives a DOWNLINK DIRECT TRANSFER message, and the signalling connection identified with the IE "CN domain identity" does not exist according to the variable ESTABLISHED_SIGNALLING_CONNECTIONS, the UE shall:
1>	ignore the content of the DOWNLINK DIRECT TRANSFER message;
1>	transmit an RRC STATUS message on the uplink DCCH using AM RLC;
1>	include the IE "Identification of received message"; and
1>	set the IE "Received message type" to DOWNLINK DIRECT TRANSFER; and
1>	set the IE "RRC transaction identifier" to the value of "RRC transaction identifier" in the entry for the DOWNLINK DIRECT TRANSFER message in the table "Accepted transactions" in the variable TRANSACTIONS; and
1>	clear that entry;
1>	include the IE "Protocol error information" with the IE "Protocol error cause" set to "Message not compatible with receiver state".
When the RRC STATUS message has been submitted to lower layers for transmission, the UE shall:
1>	continue with any ongoing processes and procedures as if the DOWNLINK DIRECT TRANSFER message has not been received.
8.1.9.4	Invalid DOWNLINK DIRECT TRANSFER message
If the UE receives a DOWNLINK DIRECT TRANSFER message, which contains a protocol error causing the variable PROTOCOL_ERROR_REJECT to be set to TRUE according to clause 9, the UE shall perform procedure specific error handling as follows:
1>	transmit an RRC STATUS message on the uplink DCCH using AM RLC;
1>	include the IE "Identification of received message"; and
1>	set the IE "Received message type" to DOWNLINK DIRECT TRANSFER; and
1>	set the IE "RRC transaction identifier" to the value of "RRC transaction identifier" in the entry for the DOWNLINK DIRECT TRANSFER message in the table "Rejected transactions" in the variable TRANSACTIONS; and
1>	clear that entry;
1>	include the IE "Protocol error information" with contents set to the value of the variable PROTOCOL_ERROR_INFORMATION.
When the RRC STATUS message has been submitted to lower layers for transmission, the UE shall:
1>	continue with any ongoing processes and procedures as if the invalid DOWNLINK DIRECT TRANSFER message has not been received.
8.1.10	Uplink Direct transfer

8.1.10.1	General
The uplink direct transfer procedure is used in the uplink direction to carry all subsequent upper layer (NAS) messages over the radio interface belonging to a signalling connection.
8.1.10.2	Initiation of uplink direct transfer procedure in the UE
In the UE, the uplink direct transfer procedure shall be initiated when the upper layers request a transfer of a NAS message on an existing signalling connection. When not stated otherwise elsewhere, the UE may initiate the uplink direct transfer procedure when another procedure is ongoing, and in that case the state of the latter procedure shall not be affected.
Upon initiation of the uplink direct transfer procedure in CELL_PCH or URA_PCH state, the UE shall:
1>	perform a cell update procedure, according to subclause 8.3.1, using the cause "uplink data transmission";
1>	when the cell update procedure has been completed successfully:
2>	continue with the uplink direct transfer procedure as below.
The UE shall transmit the UPLINK DIRECT TRANSFER message on the uplink DCCH using AM RLC on signalling radio bearer RB3 or signalling radio bearer RB4. The UE shall:
1>	if upper layers indicate "low priority" for this message:
2>	select signalling radio bearer RB4, if available. Specifically, for a GSM-MAP based CN, signalling radio bearer RB4 shall, if available, be selected when "SAPI 3" is requested;
2>	select signalling radio bearer RB3 when signalling radio bearer RB4 is not available;
1>	if upper layers indicate "high priority" for this message:
2>	select signalling radio bearer RB3. Specifically, for a GSM-MAP based CN, signalling radio bearer RB3 shall be selected when "SAPI 0" is requested.
The UE shall set the IE "NAS message" as received from upper layers and set the IE "CN domain identity" as indicated by the upper layers.
When the successful delivery of the UPLINK DIRECT TRANSFER message has been confirmed by RLC the procedure ends.
8.1.10.2a	RLC re-establishment or inter-RAT change
If signalling radio bearer RB n (where n equals to 3 or 4) was used when transmitting the UPLINK DIRECT TRANSFER message and a re-establishment of the transmitting side of the RLC entity on the same signalling radio bearer RB n occurs before the successful delivery of the UPLINK DIRECT TRANSFER message has been confirmed by RLC, the UE shall:
1>	retransmit the UPLINK DIRECT TRANSFER message on the uplink DCCH using AM RLC on signalling radio bearer RB n.
If an Inter-RAT handover from UTRAN procedure occurs before the successful delivery of the UPLINK DIRECT TRANSFER message has been confirmed by RLC, for messages with the IE "CN domain identity" set to "CS domain", the UE shall:
1>	retransmit the NAS message as specified in subclause 8.3.7.4.
8.1.10.2b	Inter-RAT handover from UTRAN to GERAN Iu mode
If an Inter-RAT handover from UTRAN to GERAN Iu mode occurs before the successful delivery of the UPLINK DIRECT TRANSFER message has been confirmed by RLC, for messages for all CN domains, the UE shall:
1>	retransmit the NAS message as specified in subclause 8.3.7.4.
8.1.10.3	Reception of UPLINK DIRECT TRANSFER message by the UTRAN
On reception of the UPLINK DIRECT TRANSFER message the NAS message should be routed using the value indicated in the IE "CN domain identity".
When the UTRAN receives an UPLINK DIRECT TRANSFER message, it shall not affect the state of any other ongoing RRC procedures, when not stated otherwise elsewhere.
8.1.11	UE dedicated paging

Figure 8.1.11-1: UE dedicated paging
8.1.11.1	General
This procedure is used to transmit dedicated paging information to one UE in connected mode in CELL_DCH or CELL_FACH state. Upper layers in the network may request initiation of paging.
8.1.11.2	Initiation
For a UE in CELL_DCH or CELL_FACH state, UTRAN initiates the procedure by transmitting a PAGING TYPE 2 message on the DCCH using AM RLC. When not stated otherwise elsewhere, the UTRAN may initiate the UE dedicated paging procedure also when another RRC procedure is ongoing, and in that case the state of the latter procedure shall not be affected.
UTRAN should set the IE "Paging cause" to the cause for paging received from upper layers. If no cause for paging is received from upper layers, UTRAN should set the value "Terminating – cause unknown".
8.1.11.3	Reception of a PAGING TYPE 2 message by the UE
When the UE receives a PAGING TYPE 2 message, it shall not affect the state of any other ongoing RRC procedures, when not stated otherwise elsewhere.
The UE shall:
1>	indicate reception of paging; and
1>	forward the IE "Paging cause" and the IE "Paging record type identifier" to upper layers.
The UE shall:
1>	clear the entry for the PAGING TYPE 2 message in the table "Accepted transactions" in the variable TRANSACTIONS.
8.1.11.4	Invalid PAGING TYPE 2 message
If the UE receives a PAGING TYPE 2 message, which contains a protocol error causing the variable PROTOCOL_ERROR_REJECT to be set to TRUE according to clause 9, the UE shall perform procedure specific error handling as follows:
1>	transmit an RRC STATUS message on the uplink DCCH using AM RLC;
1>	include the IE "Identification of received message"; and
1>	set the IE "Received message type" to PAGING TYPE 2; and
1>	set the IE "RRC transaction identifier" to the value of "RRC transaction identifier" in the entry for the PAGING TYPE 2 message in the table "Rejected transactions" in the variable TRANSACTIONS; and
1>	clear that entry;
1>	include the IE "Protocol error information" with contents set to the value of the variable PROTOCOL_ERROR_INFORMATION;
1>	when the RRC STATUS message has been submitted to lower layers for transmission:
2>	continue with any ongoing processes and procedures as if the invalid PAGING TYPE 2 message has not been received.
8.1.12	Security mode control

Figure 8.1.12-1: Security mode control procedure
8.1.12.1	General
The purpose of this procedure is to trigger the start of ciphering or to command the restart of the ciphering with a new ciphering configuration, for the radio bearers of one CN domain and for all signalling radio bearers.
It is also used to start integrity protection or to modify the integrity protection configuration for all signalling radio bearers.
8.1.12.2	Initiation
8.1.12.2.1	Ciphering configuration change
To start/restart ciphering, UTRAN sends a SECURITY MODE COMMAND message on the downlink DCCH in AM RLC using the most recent ciphering configuration. If no such ciphering configuration exists then the SECURITY MODE COMMAND is not ciphered. UTRAN should not transmit a SECURITY MODE COMMAND to signal a change in ciphering algorithm.
When configuring ciphering, UTRAN should ensure that the UE needs to store at most two different ciphering configurations (keyset and algorithm) per CN domain, in total over all radio bearers at any given time. For signalling radio bearers the total number of ciphering configurations that need to be stored is at most three. Prior to sending the SECURITY MODE COMMAND, for the CN domain indicated in the IE "CN domain identity" in the SECURITY MODE COMMAND, UTRAN should:
1>	suspend all radio bearers using RLC-AM or RLC-UM and all signalling radio bearers using RLC-AM or RLC-UM, except the signalling radio bearer used to send the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message on the downlink DCCH in RLC-AM, and except signalling radio bearer RB0, according to the following:
2>	not transmit RLC PDUs with sequence number greater than or equal to the number in IE "Radio bearer downlink ciphering activation time info" on all suspended radio bearers and all suspended signalling radio bearers.
1>	set, for the signalling radio bearer used to send the SECURITY MODE COMMAND, the "RLC sequence number" in IE "Radio bearer downlink ciphering activation time info" in the IE "Ciphering mode info", at which time the new ciphering configuration shall be applied;
NOTE:	The UTRAN should avoid the situation that the UE is aware of more than one pending downlink ciphering activation times for SRB2. In such a case the UE behaviour is unspecified.
1>	if a transparent mode radio bearer for this CN domain exists:
2>	include the IE "Ciphering activation time for DPCH" in IE "Ciphering mode info", at which time the new ciphering configuration shall be applied and specify a CFN value for this IE that is a multiple of 8 frames (CFN mod 8 = 0).
NOTE:	UTRAN should chose the value for the IE "Ciphering activation time for DPCH" such that the new ciphering configuration will occur after all the pending ciphering activation times have been reached for the transparent mode radio bearers of this CN domain.
1>	consider a ciphering activation time in downlink to be pending until the RLC sequence number of the next RLC PDU to be transmitted for the first time is equal to or larger than the selected activation time;
1>	set, for each suspended radio bearer and signalling radio bearer that has no pending ciphering activation time set by a previous security mode control procedure, an "RLC sequence number" in IE "Radio bearer downlink ciphering activation time info" in the IE "Ciphering mode info", at which time the new ciphering configuration shall be applied;
1>	set, for each suspended radio bearer and signalling radio bearer that has a pending ciphering activation time set by a previous security mode control procedure, the "RLC sequence number" in IE "Radio bearer downlink ciphering activation time info" in the IE "Ciphering mode info" to the value used in the previous security mode control procedure, at which time the latest ciphering configuration shall be applied;
1>	if Integrity protection has already been started for the UE:
2>	if for the CN domain indicated in the IE "CN domain identity" in the SECURITY MODE COMMAND, a new security key set (new ciphering and integrity protection keys) has been received from upper layers since the transmission of the last SECURITY MODE COMMAND message for that CN domain:
3>	include the IE "Integrity protection mode info" in the SECURITY MODE COMMAND.
2>	if the IE "CN domain identity" in the SECURITY MODE COMMAND is different from the IE "CN domain identity" that was sent in the previous SECURITY MODE COMMAND message to the UE:
3>	include the IE "Integrity protection mode info" in the SECURITY MODE COMMAND.
1>	transmit the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message on RB2.
8.1.12.2.2	Integrity protection configuration change
To start or modify integrity protection, UTRAN sends a SECURITY MODE COMMAND message on the downlink DCCH in AM RLC using the new integrity protection configuration. UTRAN should not "modify" integrity protection for a CN domain to which a SECURITY MODE COMMAND configuring integrity protection has been previously sent for an ongoing signalling connection unless the application of new integrity keys needs to be signalled to the UE. UTRAN should not transmit a SECURITY MODE COMMAND to signal a change in integrity protection algorithm.
In case of Inter-RAT handover to UTRAN, after the reception of the HANDOVER TO UTRAN COMPLETE message and a key set is received, UTRAN should transmit a SECURITY MODE COMMAND message containing IE "Integrity protection mode info" in order to initiate integrity protection with the integrity key of the key set used in the other RAT (see subclause 8.3.6.3).
When configuring Integrity protection, UTRAN should:
1>	ensure that the UE needs to store at most three different Integrity protection configurations (keysets) at any given time. This includes the total number of Integrity protection configurations for all signalling radio bearers;
1>	if Ciphering has already been started for the UE for the CN domain to be set in the IE "CN domain identity" in the SECURITY MODE COMMAND:
2>	if for the CN domain indicated in the IE "CN domain identity" in the SECURITY MODE COMMAND, a new security key set (new ciphering and integrity protection keys) has been received from upper layers since the transmission of the last SECURITY MODE COMMAND message for that CN domain:
3>	include the IE "Ciphering mode info" in the SECURITY MODE COMMAND.
1>	if Ciphering has already been configured for the UE for a CN domain different from the CN domain to be set in the IE "CN domain identity" in the SECURITY MODE COMMAND:
2>	include the IE "Ciphering mode info" in the SECURITY MODE COMMAND.
Prior to sending the SECURITY MODE COMMAND, for the CN domain indicated in the IE "CN domain identity" in the SECURITY MODE COMMAND, UTRAN should:
1>	if this is the first SECURITY MODE COMMAND sent for this RRC connection:
2>	if new keys have been received:
3>	initialise the hyper frame numbers as follows:
4>	set all bits of the hyper frame numbers of the COUNT-I values for all signalling radio bearers to zero.
2>	else (if new keys have not been received):
3>	use the value "START" in the most recently received IE "START list" or IE "START" that belongs to the CN domain indicated in the IE "CN domain identity" to initialise all hyper frame numbers of COUNT-I for all the signalling radio bearers by:
4>	setting the 20 most significant bits of the hyper frame numbers for all signalling radio bearers to the value "START" in the most recently received IE "START list" or IE "START" for that CN domain;
4>	setting the remaining bits of the hyper frame numbers equal to zero.
1>	else (this is not the first SECURITY MODE COMMAND sent for this RRC connection):
2>	if new keys have been received:
3>	initialise the hyper frame number for COUNT-I for RB2 as follows:
4>	set all bits of the HFN of the COUNT-I value for RB2 to zero.
2>	if new keys have not been received:
3>	initialise the hyper frame number for COUNT-I for RB2 as follows:
4>	set the 20 most significant bits of the HFN of the downlink and uplink COUNT-I to the value of the most recently received IE "START" or IE "START list" for the CN domain to be set in the IE "CN Domain Identity";
4>	set the remaining bits of the HFN of the downlink and uplink COUNT-I to zero.
1>	if the IE "Integrity protection mode command" has the value "Start":
2>	prohibit the transmission of signalling messages with any RRC SN on all signalling radio bearers, except RB2;
2>	set the FRESH value in the IE "Integrity protection initialisation number", included in the IE "Integrity protection mode info".
1>	if the IE "Integrity protection mode command" has the value "Modify":
2>	for each signalling radio bearer RBn, except RB2:
3>	prohibit the transmission of signalling messages with RRC SN greater or equal to the RRC sequence number in entry for signalling radio bearer n in the "RRC message sequence number list" in the IE "Downlink integrity protection activation info", included in the IE "Integrity protection mode info".
2>	consider an integrity protection activation time in downlink to be pending until the selected activation time is equal to the next RRC sequence number to be used, which means that the last RRC message using the old integrity protection configuration has been submitted to lower layers;
2>	set, for each signalling radio bearer RBn, that has no pending integrity protection activation time set by a previous security mode control procedure, an RRC sequence number in entry for signalling radio bearer n in the "RRC message sequence number list" in the IE "Downlink integrity protection activation info", included in the IE "Integrity protection mode info", at which time the new integrity protection configuration shall be applied;
2>	set, for each signalling radio bearer RBn, that has a pending integrity protection activation time set by a previous security mode control procedure, the RRC sequence number in entry for signalling radio bearer n in the "RRC message sequence number list" in the IE "Downlink integrity protection activation info", included in the IE "Integrity protection mode info", to the value used in the previous security mode control procedure, at which time the latest integrity protection configuration shall be applied.
1>	transmit the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message on RB2 using the new integrity protection configuration.
NOTE1:	In the case of re-initialisation of Integrity Protection at HFN wrap around, the network should take into account the UE actions as described in subclauses 8.5.10.1 and 8.5.10.2.
NOTE2:	After the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message is transmitted, the network should ensure that it can revert back to old integrity protection until it receives the SECURITY MODE COMPLETE message, to take into account the UE actions when security mode control procedure is unsuccessful. The network should also be aware that the UE may revert to old configuration when waiting for the acknowledgement from L2 for the SECURITY MODE COMPLETE message, and act accordingly.
NOTE3:	In the case of the first SECURITY MODE COMMAND message following an SRNS relocation, the network should set the IE "Downlink integrity protection activation info" for SRB3 and SRB4 to at least "the current downlink RRC sequence number +2". As a consequence, at least the first message sent on SRB3 and SRB4 by the Target RNC will use the old integrity protection configuration.
8.1.12.3	Reception of SECURITY MODE COMMAND message by the UE
Upon reception of the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message, the UE shall:
1>	if neither IE "Ciphering mode info" nor IE "Integrity protection mode info" is included in the SECURITY MODE COMMAND:
2>	set the variable INVALID_CONFIGURATION to TRUE.
1>	if the IE "Security capability" is the same as indicated by variable UE_CAPABILITY_TRANSFERRED, and the IE "GSM security capability" (if included in the SECURITY MODE COMMAND) is the same as indicated by the variable UE_CAPABILITY_TRANSFERRED:

2>	set the IE "RRC transaction identifier" in the SECURITY MODE COMPLETE message to the value of "RRC transaction identifier" in the entry for the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message in the table "Accepted transactions" in the variable TRANSACTIONS; and

3>	perform the actions as specified in subclause 8.6.3.4.
2>	if the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message contained the IE "Integrity protection mode info":
3>	perform the actions as specified in subclause 8.6.3.5.
1>	prior to sending the SECURITY MODE COMPLETE message:
2>	use the old ciphering configuration for this message;
2>	if the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message contained the IE "Ciphering mode info":
3>	include and set the IE "Radio bearer uplink ciphering activation time info" to the value of the variable RB_UPLINK_CIPHERING_ACTIVATION_TIME_INFO;
3>	for each radio bearer and signalling radio bearer that belongs to the CN domain as indicated in the variable LATEST_CONFIGURED_CN_DOMAIN:
4>	start or continue incrementing the COUNT-C values for all RLC-AM and RLC-UM signalling radio bearers at the ciphering activation time as specified in the procedure;
4>	start or continue incrementing the COUNT-C values common for all transparent mode radio bearers for this CN domain at the ciphering activation time as specified in the procedure;

5>	set the 20 most significant bits of the HFN component of the downlink COUNT-C to the value "START" in the most recently transmitted IE "START list" or IE "START", at the reception of the SECURITY MODE COMMAND, that belongs to the CN domain as indicated in the variable LATEST_CONFIGURED_CN_DOMAIN;
5>	set the remaining bits of the hyper frame numbers to zero.
3>	if new keys have been received:
4>	perform the actions in subclause 8.1.12.3.1.
2>	if the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message contained the IE "Integrity protection mode info":
3>	include and set the IE "Uplink integrity protection activation info" to the value of the variable INTEGRITY_PROTECTION_ACTIVATION_INFO for each signalling radio bearer;
3>	if no new security key set (new ciphering and integrity protection keys) has been received from the upper layers [40] for the CN domain as indicated in the variable LATEST_CONFIGURED_CN_DOMAIN, for RB2:

5>	set the remaining bits of the IE "Uplink RRC HFN" to zero.
3>	if no new security key set (new ciphering and integrity protection keys) has been received from the upper layers [40] for the CN domain indicated in the variable LATEST_CONFIGURED_CN_DOMAIN, for each signalling radio bearer other than RB2:
4>	if the IE "Integrity protection mode command" has the value "start":

2>	transmit the SECURITY MODE COMPLETE message on RB2.
NOTE:	After submission of the SECURITY MODE COMPLETE message to the lower layers, the UE should accept messages received in the DL which require the new security configuration to be applied on them. If the received message is successfully integrity checked, the UE should not discard the message due to lack of completion of the security procedure, caused by the successful delivery of the SECURITY MODE COMPLETE not having yet been confirmed by lower layers, unless the security configuration to be applied has been aborted and the message received requires integrity protection [5].
1>	when the successful delivery of the SECURITY MODE COMPLETE message has been confirmed by RLC:

4>	perform the actions in subclause 8.1.12.3.1.
3>	allow the transmission of RRC messages on all signalling radio bearers with any RRC SN;
3>	set "Uplink RRC Message sequence number" for signalling radio bearer RB0 in the variable INTEGRITY_PROTECTION_INFO to a value such that next RRC message to be sent on uplink RB0 will use the new integrity protection configuration and the "RRC Message sequence number" in the IE "Integrity check info" in the next RRC message will equal to the activation time for RB0 as indicated in IE "Uplink integrity protection activation info" included in the transmitted SECURITY MODE COMPLETE;

8.1.12.4	Void

8.1.12.4a	Incompatible simultaneous security reconfiguration
If the variable INCOMPATIBLE_SECURITY_RECONFIGURATION becomes set to TRUE of the received SECURITY MODE COMMAND message, the UE shall:

3>	does not take into account the HFN from the received SECURITY MODE COMMAND message.
2>	if the UE has already submitted the SECURITY MODE COMPLETE message, use a COUNT-I value for transmission of the next message on SRB2 as stated below:
3>	take the COUNT-I used prior to the transmission of  the SECURITY MODE COMPLETE message;
3>	increment  that COUNT-I with 2;
3>	apply that COUNT-I on the next message to transmit.
2>	clear the variable SECURITY_MODIFICATION;
2>	the procedure ends.
8.1.12.4c	Invalid configuration
If the variable INVALID_CONFIGURATION is set to TRUE due to the received SECURITY MODE COMMAND message, the UE shall:
1>	transmit a SECURITY MODE FAILURE message on the DCCH using AM RLC after setting the IEs as specified below:
2>	set the IE "RRC transaction identifier" in the SECURITY MODE FAILURE message to the value of "RRC transaction identifier" in the entry for the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message in the table "Accepted transactions" in the variable TRANSACTIONS; and
2>	clear that entry;
2>	set the IE "failure cause" to the cause value "invalid configuration".
1>	when the response message has been submitted to lower layers for transmission:
2>	set the variable INVALID_CONFIGURATION to FALSE;
2>	set the IE "Reconfiguration" in the variable CIPHERING_STATUS to FALSE;
2>	continue with any ongoing processes and procedures as if the invalid SECURITY MODE COMMAND message has not been received;
2>	only accept a message on SRB 2, with a COUNT-I that:
3>	is higher than the COUNT-I used prior to receiving the  SECURITY MODE COMMAND message incremented by one; and
3>	does not take into account the HFN from the received SECURITY MODE COMMAND message.
2>	and the procedure ends.
8.1.12.5	Reception of SECURITY MODE COMPLETE message by the UTRAN
UTRAN should apply integrity protection on the received SECURITY MODE COMPLETE message and all subsequent messages with the new integrity protection configuration, if changed. When UTRAN has received a SECURITY MODE COMPLETE message and the integrity protection has successfully been applied, UTRAN should:
1>	if the IE "Ciphering mode info" was included in the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message:
2>	if new keys were received for the CN domain set in the IE "CN Domain Identity" in the SECURITY MODE COMMAND:
3>	set, at the downlink and uplink activation time, all the bits of the hyper frame numbers of the downlink and uplink COUNT-C values respectively for all radio bearers for this CN domain and all signalling radio bearers to zero.
2>	else (if new keys were not received):
3>	use, at the downlink and uplink activation time, the value "START" in the most recently received IE "START list" or IE "START" that belongs to the CN domain as indicated in the IE "CN domain identity" to initialise all hyper frame numbers of the downlink and uplink COUNT-C values respectively for all the signalling radio bearers as follows:
4>	set the 20 most significant bits of the hyper frame numbers of the COUNT-C for all signalling radio bearers to the value "START" in the most recently received IE "START list" or IE "START" for that CN domain;
4>	set the remaining bits of the hyper frame numbers equal to zero.
1>	if the IE "Integrity protection mode info" was included in the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message:
2>	if this was not the first SECURITY MODE COMMAND message for this RRC connection:
3>	if new keys have been received for the CN domain set in the IE "CN Domain Identity" included in the transmitted SECURITY MODE COMMAND message:
4>	initialise, at the downlink and uplink activation time, all hyper frame numbers of the downlink and uplink COUNT-I values respectively for all the signalling radio bearers other than RB2 as follows:
5>	set all bits of the hyper frame numbers of the uplink and downlink COUNT-I to zero.
3>	if no new keys have been received for the CN domain set in the IE "CN Domain Identity" included in the transmitted SECURITY MODE COMMAND message:
4>	use, at the downlink and uplink activation time, the value "START" in the most recently received IE "START list" or IE "START" that belongs to the CN domain as indicated in the IE "CN domain identity" to initialise all hyper frame numbers of the downlink and uplink COUNT-I values respectively for all the signalling radio bearers other than RB2 as follows:
5>	set the 20 most significant bits of the hyper frame numbers of the downlink and uplink COUNT-I respectively for all signalling radio bearers to the value "START" in the most recently received IE "START list" or IE "START" for that CN domain;
5>	set the remaining bits of the hyper frame numbers equal to zero.
1>	send an indication to upper layers that the new security configuration has been activated;
1>	resume, in the downlink, all suspended radio bearers and all signalling radio bearers;
1>	allow the transmission of RRC messages on all signalling radio bearers with any RRC SN;
1>	if the IE "Integrity protection mode command" included in the SECURITY MODE COMMAND had the value "Start":
2>	start applying integrity protection in the downlink for all signalling radio bearers.
1>	if the IE "Integrity protection mode command" included in the SECURITY MODE COMMAND had the value "Modify":
2>	start applying the new integrity protection configuration in the downlink at the RRC sequence number, for each signalling radio bearers RBn, except for signalling radio bearer RB2, indicated by the entry for signalling radio bearer n in the "RRC message sequence number list" in the IE "Downlink integrity protection activation info";
2>	continue applying the new integrity configuration for signalling radio bearer RB2;
2>	apply the new integrity protection configuration on the received signalling messages with RRC SN greater than or equal to the number associated with the signalling radio bearer in IE "Uplink integrity protection activation info".
1>	apply the old ciphering configuration for the transmission of RLC PDUs with RLC sequence number less than the number indicated in the IE "Radio bearer downlink ciphering activation time info" included in the IE "Ciphering mode info";
1>	apply the new ciphering configuration for the transmission of RLC PDUs with RLC sequence number greater than or equal to the number indicated in IE "Radio bearer downlink ciphering activation time info" included in the IE "Ciphering mode info";
1>	apply the old integrity protection configuration on the received signalling messages with RRC SN smaller than the number associated with the signalling radio bearer in IE "Uplink integrity protection activation info";
1>	for radio bearers using RLC-AM or RLC-UM:
2>	use the old ciphering configuration for received RLC PDUs with RLC sequence number less than the RLC sequence number indicated in the IE "Radio bearer uplink ciphering activation time info" sent by the UE;
2>	use the new ciphering configuration for received RLC PDUs with RLC sequence number greater than or equal to the RLC sequence number indicated in the IE "Radio bearer uplink ciphering activation time info" sent by the UE;
2>	if an RLC reset or re-establishment of the transmitting side of an RLC entity occurs after the SECURITY MODE COMPLETE message has been received by UTRAN before the downlink activation time for the new ciphering configuration has been reached, ignore the activation time and apply the new ciphering configuration in downlink immediately after the RLC reset or RLC re-establishment;
2>	if an RLC reset or re-establishment of the receiving side of an RLC entity occurs after the SECURITY MODE COMPLETE message has been received by UTRAN before the uplink activation time for the new ciphering configuration has been reached, ignore the activation time and apply the new ciphering configuration in uplink immediately after the RLC reset or RLC re-establishment.
1>	for radio bearers using RLC-TM:
2>	use the old ciphering configuration for the received RLC PDUs before the CFN as indicated in the IE "Ciphering activation time for DPCH" in the IE "Ciphering mode info" as included in the SECURITY MODE COMMAND;
2>	use the new ciphering configuration for the received RLC PDUs at the CFN as indicated in the IE "Ciphering activation time for DPCH" in the IE "Ciphering mode info" as included in the SECURITY MODE COMMAND.
1>	and the procedure ends.
8.1.12.6	Invalid SECURITY MODE COMMAND message
If the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message contains a protocol error causing the variable PROTOCOL_ERROR_REJECT to be set to TRUE according to clause 9, the UE shall perform procedure specific error handling as follows:
1>	transmit a SECURITY MODE FAILURE message on the uplink DCCH using AM RLC;
1>	set the IE "RRC transaction identifier" in the SECURITY MODE FAILURE message to the value of "RRC transaction identifier" in the entry for the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message in the table "Rejected transactions" in the variable TRANSACTIONS; and
1>	clear that entry;
1>	set the IE "failure cause" to the cause value "protocol error";
1>	include the IE "Protocol error information" with contents set to the value of the variable PROTOCOL_ERROR_INFORMATION;
1>	when the response message has been submitted to lower layers for transmission:
2>	continue with any ongoing processes and procedures as if the invalid SECURITY MODE COMMAND message has not been received;
2>	only accept a message on SRB 2, with a COUNT-I that:
3>	is higher than the COUNT-I used prior to receiving the  SECURITY MODE COMMAND message incremented by one; and 
3>	does not take into account the HFN from the received SECURITY MODE COMMAND message.
2>	and the procedure ends.
8.1.13	Signalling connection release procedure

Figure 8.1.13-1: Signalling connection release procedure, normal case
8.1.13.1	General
The signalling connection release procedure is used to notify to the UE that one of its ongoing signalling connections has been released. The procedure does not initiate the release of the RRC connection.
8.1.13.2	Initiation of SIGNALLING CONNECTION RELEASE by the UTRAN
To initiate the procedure, the UTRAN transmits a SIGNALLING CONNECTION RELEASE message on DCCH using AM RLC.
8.1.13.3	Reception of SIGNALLING CONNECTION RELEASE by the UE
Upon reception of a SIGNALLING CONNECTION RELEASE message, the UE shall:
1>	indicate the release of the signalling connection and pass the value of the IE "CN domain identity" to upper layers;
1>	remove the signalling connection with the identity indicated by the IE "CN domain identity" from the variable ESTABLISHED_SIGNALLING_CONNECTIONS;
1>	clear the entry for the SIGNALLING CONNECTION RELEASE message in the table "Accepted transactions" in the variable TRANSACTIONS;
1>	the procedure ends.
8.1.13.4	Invalid SIGNALLING CONNECTION RELEASE message
If the UE receives a SIGNALLING CONNECTION RELEASE message, which contains a protocol error causing the variable PROTOCOL_ERROR_REJECT to be set to TRUE according to clause 9, the UE shall perform procedure specific error handling as follows:
1>	include the IE "Identification of received message"; and
2>	set the IE "Received message type" to SIGNALLING CONNECTION RELEASE;
2>	set the IE "RRC transaction identifier" to the value of "RRC transaction identifier" in the entry for the SIGNALLING CONNECTION RELEASE message in the table "Rejected transactions" in the variable TRANSACTIONS; and
2>	clear that entry.
1>	include the IE "Protocol error information" with contents set to the value of the variable PROTOCOL_ERROR_INFORMATION;
1>	transmit an RRC STATUS message on the uplink DCCH using AM RLC
1>	when the RRC STATUS message has been submitted to lower layers for transmission:
2>	continue with any ongoing processes and procedures as if the invalid SIGNALLING CONNECTION RELEASE message has not been received.
8.1.13.5	Invalid configuration
If radio access bearers for the CN domain indicated by the IE "CN domain identity" exist in the variable ESTABLISHED_RABS, the UE shall:
1>	transmit an RRC STATUS message on the uplink DCCH using AM RLC;
1>	include the IE "Identification of received message"; and
1>	set the IE "Received message type" to SIGNALLING CONNECTION RELEASE; and
1>	set the IE "RRC transaction identifier" to the value of "RRC transaction identifier" in the entry for the SIGNALLING CONNECTION RELEASE message in the table "Accepted transactions" in the variable TRANSACTIONS and clear that entry;
1>	include the IE "Protocol error information" with contents set to the value "Message not compatible with receiver state";
1>	when the RRC STATUS message has been submitted to lower layers for transmission:
2>	continue with any ongoing processes and procedures as if the invalid SIGNALLING CONNECTION RELEASE message has not been received.
8.1.14	Signalling connection release indication procedure

Figure 8.1.14-1: Signalling connection release indication procedure, normal case
8.1.14.1	General
The signalling connection release indication procedure is used by the UE to indicate to the UTRAN that one of its signalling connections has been released. The procedure may in turn initiate the RRC connection release procedure.
8.1.14.2	Initiation
The UE shall, on receiving a request to release (abort) the signalling connection from upper layers for a specific CN domain:
1>	if a signalling connection in the variable ESTABLISHED_SIGNALLING_CONNECTIONS for the specific CN domain identified with the IE "CN domain identity" exists:
2>	initiate the signalling connection release indication procedure.
1>	otherwise:
2>	abort any ongoing establishment of signalling connection for that specific CN domain as specified in 8.1.3.5a.
Upon initiation of the signalling connection release indication procedure in CELL_PCH or URA_PCH state, the UE shall:
1>	perform a cell update procedure, according to subclause 8.3.1, using the cause "uplink data transmission";
1>	when the cell update procedure completed successfully:
2>	continue with the signalling connection release indication procedure as below.
The UE shall:
1>	set the IE "CN Domain Identity" to the value indicated by the upper layers. The value of the IE indicates the CN domain whose associated signalling connection the upper layers are indicating to be released;
1>	remove the signalling connection with the identity indicated by upper layers from the variable ESTABLISHED_SIGNALLING_CONNECTIONS;
1>	transmit a SIGNALLING CONNECTION RELEASE INDICATION message on DCCH using AM RLC.
When the successful delivery of the SIGNALLING CONNECTION RELEASE INDICATION message has been confirmed by RLC the procedure ends.
8.1.14.2a	RLC re-establishment or inter-RAT change
If a re-establishment of the transmitting side of the RLC entity on signalling radio bearer RB2 occurs before the successful delivery of the SIGNALLING CONNECTION RELEASE INDICATION message has been confirmed by RLC, the UE shall:
1>	retransmit the SIGNALLING CONNECTION RELEASE INDICATION message on the uplink DCCH using AM RLC on signalling radio bearer RB2.
If an Inter-RAT handover from UTRAN procedure occurs before the successful delivery of the SIGNALLING CONNECTION RELEASE INDICATION message has been confirmed by RLC, the UE shall:
1>	abort the signalling connection while in the new RAT.
8.1.14.3	Reception of SIGNALLING CONNECTION RELEASE INDICATION by the UTRAN
Upon reception of a SIGNALLING CONNECTION RELEASE INDICATION message, the UTRAN requests the release of the signalling connection from upper layers. Upper layers may then initiate the release of the signalling connection.
8.1.15	Counter check procedure

Figure 8.1.15-1: Counter check procedure
8.1.15.1	General
The counter check procedure is used by the UTRAN to perform a local authentication. The purpose of the procedure is to check that the amount of data sent in both directions (uplink and downlink) over the duration of the RRC connection is identical at the UTRAN and at the UE (to detect a possible intruder – a 'man-in-the-middle' – from operating).
This procedure is only applicable to radio bearers, and only to radio bearers using RLC-AM or RLC-UM. It should be noted that this requires that the COUNT-C values for each UL and DL radio bearers using RLC-AM or RLC-UM continue to be incremented even if ciphering is not used. This procedure is not applicable to signalling radio bearers.
8.1.15.2	Initiation
The UTRAN monitors the COUNT-C value associated with each radio bearer using UM or AM RLC. The procedure is triggered whenever any of these values reaches a critical checking value. The granularity of these checking values and the values themselves are defined to the UTRAN by the visited network. The UTRAN initiates the procedure by sending a COUNTER CHECK message on the downlink DCCH.
8.1.15.3	Reception of a COUNTER CHECK message by the UE
When the UE receives a COUNTER CHECK message it shall compare the COUNT-C MSB values received in the IE "RB COUNT-C MSB information" in the COUNTER CHECK message to the COUNT-C MSB values of the corresponding radio bearers.
The UE shall:
1>	set the IE "RRC transaction identifier" in the COUNTER CHECK RESPONSE message to the value of "RRC transaction identifier" in the entry for the COUNTER CHECK message in the table "Accepted transactions" in the variable TRANSACTIONS; and
1>	clear that entry.
If:
-	there is one or more radio bearer(s) using UM or AM RLC mode stored in the variable ESTABLISHED_RABS, which is (are) not included in the IE "RB COUNT-C MSB information"; or
-	there is one or more radio bearer(s) included in the IE "RB COUNT-C MSB information", which is (are) not stored in the variable ESTABLISHED_RABS; or
-	for any radio bearer (excluding signalling radio bearers) using UM or AM RLC mode stored in the variable ESTABLISHED_RABS and included in the IE "RB COUNT-C MSB information" with COUNT-C MSB values different from the MSB part of the COUNT-C values in the UE:
the UE shall:
1>	include these radio bearers in the IE "RB COUNT-C information" in the COUNTER CHECK RESPONSE message. For any RB which is included in the IE "RB COUNT-C MSB information" in the COUNTER CHECK message but not stored in the variable ESTABLISHED_RABS in the UE, the MSB part of COUNT-C values in the COUNTER CHECK RESPONSE message shall be set identical to COUNT-C-MSB values in the COUNTER CHECK message. The LSB part shall be filled with zeroes.
The UE shall:
1>	if no COUNT-C exists for a radio bearer for a given direction (uplink or downlink) because:
2>	it is a uni-directional radio bearer configured only for the other direction (downlink or uplink respectively); or
2>	it has been configured to RLC-TM mode in one direction (uplink or downlink) and RLC-UM in the other (downlink or uplink respectively):
3>	set the COUNT-C in the IE "RB COUNT-C information" in the COUNTER CHECK RESPONSE message, to any value.
1>	submit a COUNTER CHECK RESPONSE message to lower layers for transmission on the uplink DCCH using AM RLC.
When the COUNTER CHECK RESPONSE message has been submitted to lower layers for transmission the procedure ends.
8.1.15.4	Reception of the COUNTER CHECK RESPONSE message by UTRAN
If the UTRAN receives a COUNTER CHECK RESPONSE message that does not contain any COUNT-C values, the procedure ends.
If the UTRAN receives a COUNTER CHECK RESPONSE message that contains one or several COUNT-C values the UTRAN may release the RRC connection.
8.1.15.5	Cell re-selection
If the UE performs cell re-selection anytime during this procedure it shall, without interrupting the procedure:
1>	initiate the cell update procedure according to subclause 8.3.1.
8.1.15.6	Invalid COUNTER CHECK message
If the UE receives a COUNTER CHECK message, which contains a protocol error causing the variable PROTOCOL_ERROR_REJECT to be set to TRUE according to clause 9, the UE shall perform procedure specific error handling as follows. The UE shall:
1>	transmit an RRC STATUS message on the uplink DCCH using AM RLC;
1>	include the IE "Identification of received message"; and
1>	set the IE "Received message type" to COUNTER CHECK; and
1>	set the IE "RRC transaction identifier" to the value of "RRC transaction identifier" in the entry for the UE COUNTER CHECK message in the table "Rejected transactions" in the variable TRANSACTIONS; and
1>	clear that entry;
1>	include the IE "Protocol error information" with contents set to the value of the variable PROTOCOL_ERROR_INFORMATION;
1>	when the RRC STATUS message has been submitted to lower layers for transmission:
2>	continue with any ongoing processes and procedures as if the invalid COUNTER CHECK message has not been received.
8.1.16	Inter RAT handover information transfer

Figure 8.1.16-1: Inter RAT handover information transfer, normal flow
8.1.16.1	General
The inter RAT handover information transfer procedure is used by the UE to convey RRC information needed for inter RAT handover to UTRAN.
8.1.16.2	Initiation
If:
-	a radio access technology other than UTRA, e.g. GSM, using radio access technology-specific procedures, orders the UE to provide the INTER RAT HANDOVER INFO message; or
-	a radio access technology other than UTRA, e.g. GSM, using radio access technology-specific procedures, configures the UE to send the INTER RAT HANDOVER INFO message upon system specific conditions not involving an explicit order e.g. early classmark sending upon entering connected mode; or
-	while in connected mode using another radio access technology, the inter RAT handover info changes compared to what has previously been sent via the other radio access technology:
the UE shall:
1>	initiate the inter RAT handover information transfer procedure.
To determine if the inter RAT handover info has changed compared to what has previously been sent, the UE shall:
1>	store the information last sent in the variable INTER_RAT_HANDOVER_INFO_TRANSFERRED;
1>	if this variable has not yet been set:
2>	not initiate the inter RAT handover information transfer procedure due to change of inter RAT handover info.
NOTE:	Currently neither the UE security information nor the predefined configuration status information change while in connected mode using GSM radio access technology.
8.1.16.3	INTER RAT HANDOVER INFO message contents to set
The UE shall:
1>	include the IE "UE security information", and the IE "UE security information2" if supported by the UE; and
1>	not include the IE "UE Specific Behaviour Information 1 interRAT".
1>	in case support for the compressed version of the inter RAT handover info is indicated via the other radio access technology:
	2>	include of the following IEs the IE that after encoding has the smallest size: IE "Predefined configuration status information compressed" or the IE "Predefined configuration status information";
2>	include the IE "UE radio access capability compressed". 
1>	else:
2>	include the IE "Predefined configuration status information";
2>	include the IE "UE capability container", containing the IE "UE radio access capability" and the IE "UE radio access capability extension", in accordance with the following:
3>	if the UE supports multiple UTRA FDD Frequency Bands; or
3>	if the UE supports a single UTRA FDD Frequency Band different from Band I [21]:
4>	include the IE "UE radio access capability", excluding IEs "RF capability FDD" and "Measurement capability";
4>	include the IE "UE radio access capability extension", including the IEs "RF capability FDD extension" and the "Measurement capability extension" associated with each supported UTRA FDD frequency band indicated in the IE "Frequency band".
3>	else:
4>	include the IE "UE radio access capability", including the IEs "RF capability FDD" and "Measurement capability" associated with the Band I [21];
4>	include the IE "UE radio access capability extension", including the IEs "RF capability FDD extension" and the "Measurement capability extension" associated with each supported UTRA FDD frequency band indicated in the IE "Frequency band".
1>	For FDD, include the IE "UE radio access capability comp 2";
1>	initiate the transfer of the INTER RAT HANDOVER INFO message via the other radio access technology, using radio access technology-specific procedures;
1>	store the following in the variable INTER_RAT_HANDOVER_INFO_TRANSFERRED if they were included in the INTER RAT HANDOVER INFO message:
2>	the IE "Predefined configuration status information";
2>	the IE "Predefined configuration status information compressed";
2>	the IE "UE security information";
2>	the IE "UE radio access capability";
2>	the IE "UE radio access capability extension"; and
2>	the IE "UE radio access capability compressed";
2>	if the IE "UE radio access capability compressed" were included in the INTER RAT HANDOVER INFO message:
3>	set the IE "Security Capability" to the mandatory R99 algorithms.
1>	and the procedure ends.
8.2	Radio Bearer control procedures

Figure 8.2.2-8: Transport channel reconfiguration, failure case

Figure 8.2.2-9: Physical channel reconfiguration, normal flow

Figure 8.2.2-10: Physical channel reconfiguration, failure case
8.2.2.1	General
Reconfiguration procedures include the following procedures:
-	the radio bearer establishment procedure;
-	radio bearer reconfiguration procedure;
-	the radio bearer release procedure;
-	the transport channel reconfiguration procedure; and
-	the physical channel reconfiguration procedure.
The radio bearer establishment procedure is used to establish new radio bearer(s).
The radio bearer reconfiguration procedure is used to reconfigure parameters for a radio bearer.
The radio bearer release procedure is used to release radio bearer(s).
The transport channel reconfiguration procedure is used to reconfigure transport channel parameters.
The physical channel reconfiguration procedure is used to establish, reconfigure and release physical channels.
While performing any of the above procedures, these procedures may perform a hard handover (subclause 8.3.5) and/or an HS-DSCH cell change and/or a serving E-DCH cell change. The reconfiguration procedures are also used to change the feedback configuration for HS-DSCH.
8.2.2.2	Initiation
To initiate any one of the reconfiguration procedures, UTRAN should:
1>	configure new radio links in any new physical channel configuration;
1>	start transmission and reception on the new radio links;
1>	for a radio bearer establishment procedure:
2>	transmit a RADIO BEARER SETUP message on the downlink DCCH using AM or UM RLC;
2>	if signalling radio bearer RB4 is setup with this procedure and signalling radio bearers RB1-RB3 were already established prior to the procedure:
3>	if the variable "LATEST_CONFIGURED_CN_DOMAIN" has been initialised:
4>	connect any radio bearers setup by the same message as signalling radio bearer RB4 to the CN domain indicated in the variable "LATEST CONFIGURED CN DOMAIN".
1>	for a radio bearer reconfiguration procedure:
2>	transmit a RADIO BEARER RECONFIGURATION message on the downlink DCCH using AM or UM RLC.
1>	for a radio bearer release procedure:
2>	transmit a RADIO BEARER RELEASE message on the downlink DCCH using AM or UM RLC.
1>	for a transport channel reconfiguration procedure:
2>	transmit a TRANSPORT CHANNEL RECONFIGURATION message on the downlink DCCH using AM or UM RLC.
1>	for a physical channel reconfiguration procedure:
2>	transmit a PHYSICAL CHANNEL RECONFIGURATION message on the downlink DCCH using AM or UM RLC.
1>	if the reconfiguration procedure is simultaneous with SRNS relocation procedure:
2>		if the transmitted message is a RADIO BEARER RECONFIGURATION:
3>	include the IE "New U-RNTI".
2>	else:
3>	include the IE "Downlink counter synchronisation info".
2>	if ciphering and/or integrity protection are activated:
3>	include new ciphering and/or integrity protection configuration information to be used after reconfiguration.
2>	use the downlink DCCH using AM RLC.
1>	if transport channels are added, reconfigured or deleted in uplink and/or downlink:
2>	set TFCS according to the new transport channel(s).
1>	if transport channels are added or deleted in uplink and/or downlink, and RB Mapping Info applicable to the new configuration has not been previously provided to the UE, the UTRAN should:
2>	send the RB Mapping Info for the new configuration.
In the Radio Bearer Reconfiguration procedure UTRAN may indicate that uplink transmission shall be stopped or continued on certain radio bearers. Uplink transmission on a signalling radio bearer used by the RRC signalling (signalling radio bearer RB1 or signalling radio bearer RB2) should not be stopped.
NOTE 1:		The Release '99 RADIO BEARER RECONFIGURATION message always includes the IE "RB information to reconfigure", even if UTRAN does not require the reconfiguration of any RB. In these cases, UTRAN may include only the IE "RB identity" within the IE "RB information to reconfigure".
NOTE 2:		The Release '99 RADIO BEARER RECONFIGURATION message always includes the IE "Downlink information per radio link list", even if UTRAN does not require the reconfiguration of any RL. In these cases, UTRAN may re-send the currently assigned values for the mandatory IEs included within the IE "Downlink information per radio link list ".
NOTE 3:	The Release '99 RADIO BEARER RECONFIGURATION message always includes the IE "Primary CPICH Info" (FDD) or IE "Primary CCPCH Info" (TDD) within IE "Downlink information per radio link list". This implies that in case UTRAN applies the RADIO BEARER RECONFIGURATION message to move the UE to CELL_FACH state, it has to indicate a cell. However, UTRAN may indicate any cell; the UE anyhow performs cell selection and notifies UTRAN if it selects another cell than indicated by UTRAN.
If the IE "Activation Time" is included, UTRAN should set it to a value taking the UE performance requirements into account.
UTRAN should take the UE capabilities into account when setting the new configuration.
If the message is used to initiate a transition from CELL_DCH to CELL_FACH state, the UTRAN may assign a C-RNTI to be used in that cell by the UE.
8.2.2.2a	Initiation of handover from GERAN Iu mode
To initiate the handover from GERAN Iu mode, UTRAN should:
1>	provide a RADIO BEARER RECONFIGURATION message to be encapsulated in INTERSYSTEM HANDOVER TO UTRAN COMMAND message, sent on the downlink SRB2 in GERAN Iu mode, as specified in [53].
1>	in case UTRAN decides to use a predefined or default radio configuration that is stored in the UE, it should include the following information in the RADIO BEARER RECONFIGURATION message:
-	PhyCH information elements; and
-	either:
-	the IE "Predefined configuration identity", to indicate which pre-defined configuration of RB, transport channel and physical channel parameters shall be used; or
-	the IE "Default configuration mode" and IE "Default configuration identity", to indicate which default configuration of RB, transport channel and physical channel parameters shall be used.
8.2.2.3	Reception of RADIO BEARER SETUP or RADIO BEARER RECONFIGURATION or RADIO BEARER RELEASE or TRANSPORT CHANNEL RECONFIGURATION or PHYSICAL CHANNEL RECONFIGURATION message by the UE
The UE shall:
1>	be able to receive any of the following messages:
2>	RADIO BEARER SETUP message; or
2>	RADIO BEARER RECONFIGURATION message; or
2>	RADIO BEARER RELEASE message; or
2>	TRANSPORT CHANNEL RECONFIGURATION message; or
2>	PHYSICAL CHANNEL RECONFIGURATION message;
1>	be able to perform a hard handover and apply physical layer synchronisation procedure A as specified in [29], even if no prior UE measurements have been performed on the target cell and/or frequency.

2>	on the receiving side of an RLC entity apply the new ciphering configuration in uplink immediately;
2>	on the transmitting side of an RLC entity apply the new ciphering configuration in downlink immediately.

2>	begin incrementing the COUNT-C at the CFN only as indicated in:
3>	the IE "Ciphering activation time for DPCH" in the IE "Ciphering mode info", if included in the message that triggered the radio bearer control procedure; or
3>	the IE "COUNT-C activation time", if included in the response message for this procedure.

8.2.5	Transport format combination control

Figure 8.2.5-1: Transport format combination control, normal flow

Figure 8.2.5-2: Transport format combination control, failure case
8.2.5.1	General
The transport format combination control procedure is used to control the allowed uplink transport format combinations within the transport format combination set.
8.2.5.2	Initiation
To initiate the transport format combination control procedure, the UTRAN transmits the TRANSPORT FORMAT COMBINATION CONTROL message on the downlink DCCH using AM, UM or TM RLC. When not stated otherwise elsewhere, the UTRAN may initiate the transport format combination control procedure also when another procedure is ongoing, and in that case the state of the latter procedure shall not be affected.
To change the sub-set of allowed transport format combinations, the UTRAN should:
1>	set the allowed TFCs in the IE "Transport Format Combination subset" ("TFC subset"). The UTRAN may specify the duration for which a new TFC sub-set applies by using the IE "TFC Control duration" and independently may specify the time at which a new TFC sub-set shall be applied using the IE "Activation time for TFC subset".
To remove completely the previous restrictions of allowed transport format combinations, the UTRAN should:
1>	set the IE "full transport format combination set " in the IE "TFC subset".
8.2.5.3	Reception of a TRANSPORT FORMAT COMBINATION CONTROL message by the UE
If the TRANSPORT FORMAT COMBINATION CONTROL message was received on AM RLC or UM RLC, the UE shall:
1>	act upon all received information elements as specified in 8.6, unless specified otherwise in the following;
1>	perform the actions for the transport format combination subset specified in the IE "DPCH/PUSCH TFCS in uplink" according to subclause 8.6.5.3;
1>	if the variable INVALID_CONFIGURATION is set to FALSE:
2>	if the IE "TFC Control duration" is included in the message:
3>	store the value of the IE "TFC Control duration" in the IE "Duration" in the variable TFC_SUBSET;
3>	set the IE "Current TFC subset" (for the CCTrCH indicated by the IE "TFCS Id" in case of TDD) in the variable TFC_SUBSET to the value of the IE "Transport format combination subset";
3>	at the CFN indicated by IE "Activation time for TFC subset" apply the transport format combination subset in the IE "Current TFC subset" stored in the variable TFC_SUBSET for the number of (10 ms) frames specified in the IE "Duration";
3>	at the end of the time period defined by the IE "Duration"in the variable TFC_SUBSET:
4>	if the IE "Current TFC subset" (for the CCTrCH indicated by the IE "TFCS Id" in case of TDD) in the variable TFC_SUBSET has not subsequently been changed by another message:
5>	set the value of the IE "Current TFC subset" to the value of the IE "Default TFC subset" in the variable TFC_SUBSET;
5>	clear the IE "Duration" in the variable TFC_SUBSET;
5>	apply the transport format combination subset in the IE "Current TFC subset" stored in the variable TFC_SUBSET;
2>	if the IE "TFC Control duration" is not included in the message:
3>	clear the value of the IE "Duration" in the variable TFC_SUBSET;
3>	set both the IE "Current TFC subset" and the IE "Default TFC subset" ( for the CCTrCH indicated by the IE "TFCS Id" in case of TDD) in the variable TFC_SUBSET to the value of the IE "Transport format combination subset";
3>		at the CFN indicated by the IE "Activation time for TFC subset" apply the transport format combination subset in the IE "Current TFC subset" stored in the variable TFC_SUBSET.
If the TRANSPORT FORMAT COMBINATION CONTROL message was received on TM RLC, the UE shall:
1>	if the IE "TFC subset identity" identifies one of the TFC subsets stored in the IE "TFC subset list" in the variable TFC_SUBSET:
2>	perform the actions as specified in subclause 8.6.5.3;
2>	if the variable INVALID_CONFIGURATION is set to FALSE:
3>	in the variable TFC_SUBSET, set the IE "Current TFC subset" and the IE "default TFC subset" to the value of the IE "TFC subset" in "TFC subset list" which is identified by the IE "TFC subset identity";
3>	clear the IE "Duration" in the variable TFC_SUBSET;
3>	apply the transport format combination subset in the IE "Current TFC subset" stored in the variable TFC_SUBSET.
1>	if the IE "TFC subset identity" is greater than the maximum number of TFC subsets stored in the IE "TFC subset list" in the variable TFC_SUBSET:
2>	set the variable INVALID_CONFIGURATION to TRUE. 
NOTE:	The UTRAN should only send the TRANSPORT FORMAT COMBINATION CONTROL message on TM RLC in order to control the rate of TM RBs (for example, carrying multi-rate AMR or WB-AMR) otherwise the UE behaviour is not specified.
The UE shall:
1>	clear the entry for the TRANSPORT FORMAT COMBINATION CONTROL message in the table "Accepted transactions" in the variable TRANSACTIONS;
1>	and the procedure ends.
8.2.5.4	Invalid configuration
If the variable INVALID_CONFIGURATION is set to TRUE due to the received TRANSPORT FORMAT COMBINATION CONTROL message the UE shall:
1>	if the TRANSPORT FORMAT COMBINATION CONTROL message was received on AM RLC:

8.2.7	Physical Shared Channel Allocation [TDD only]

Figure 8.2.7-1: Physical Shared Channel Allocation
8.2.7.1	General
The purpose of this procedure is to allocate radio resources to USCH and/or DSCH transport channels in TDD mode, for use by a UE. This procedure can also be used to indicate to the UE, that a PUSCH allocation is pending, in order to prevent further capacity requests from the UE.
UEs are not required to receive FACH and DSCH simultaneously, i.e. if resources are allocated to DSCH the FACH reception may be suspended.
8.2.7.2	Initiation
To initiate the Physical Shared Channel Allocation procedure, the UTRAN sends the "PHYSICAL SHARED CHANNEL ALLOCATION" message on the downlink SHCCH or on the downlink DCCH using UM RLC. The DSCH-RNTI shall be included for UE identification, if the message is sent on the SHCCH.

1>	proceed as described in subclause 8.2.8.
8.2.8	PUSCH capacity request [TDD only]

Figure 8.2.8-1: PUSCH Capacity request procedure
8.2.8.1	General
With this procedure, the UE transmits its request for PUSCH resources to the UTRAN. In the normal case, the UTRAN responds with a PHYSICAL SHARED CHANNEL ALLOCATION message, which either allocates the requested PUSCH resources, and/or allocates a PDSCH resource, or may just serve as an acknowledgement, indicating that PUSCH allocation is pending.
This procedure can also be used to acknowledge the reception of a PHYSICAL SHARED CHANNEL ALLOCATION message, or to indicate a protocol error in that message.
With the PUSCH CAPACITY REQUEST message, the UE can request capacity for one or more USCH.
8.2.8.2	Initiation
This procedure is initiated:
1>	in the CELL_FACH or CELL_DCH state;
1>	and when at least one RB using USCH has been established;
1>	and when the UE sees the requirement to request physical resources (PUSCH) for an USCH channel or there is the need to reply to a PHYSICAL SHARED CHANNEL ALLOCATION message as described in clause 8.2.7 (i.e. to confirm the reception of a message, if requested to do so, or to indicate a protocol error).
The procedure can be initiated if:
-	Timer T311 is not running.
-	The timer T310 (capacity request repetition timer) is not running.
The UE shall:
1>	set the IEs in the PUSCH CAPACITY REQUEST message according to subclause 8.2.8.3;
1>	if the procedure is triggered to reply to a previous PHYSICAL SHARED CHANNEL ALLOCATION message by the IE "Confirm request" set to "Confirm PUSCH" and the IE "PUSCH capacity allocation info" is not present:
2>	transmit the PUSCH CAPACITY REQUEST message on RACH.
1>	else:
2>	transmit the PUSCH CAPACITY REQUEST message on the uplink SHCCH.
1>	set counter V310 to 1;
1>	start timer T310.
8.2.8.3	PUSCH CAPACITY REQUEST message contents to set
With one PUSCH CAPACITY REQUEST message, capacity for one or more USCH can be requested. It shall include these information elements:
1>	DSCH-RNTI to be used as UE identity if the message is sent on RACH;
1>	Traffic volume measured results for each radio bearer satisfying the reporting criteria as specified in the MEASUREMENT CONTROL procedure (if no radio bearer satisfies the reporting criteria, traffic volume measured results shall not be included). These results shall include:
2>	Radio Bearer ID of the Radio Bearer being reported;
2>	RLC buffer payload for these radio bearers, as specified by the MEASUREMENT CONTROL procedure.
The UE shall:
1>	if the initiation of the procedure is triggered by the IE "Traffic volume report request" in a previously received PHYSICAL SHARED CHANNEL ALLOCATION message:
2>	report the traffic volume measurement result for the radio bearer mapped on USCH transport channel specified in the received message. These results shall include:
3>	Radio Bearer ID of the Radio Bearer being reported;
3>	RLC buffer payload for this radio bearer.
1>	if the initiation of the procedure is triggered by the IE "Confirm request" set to "Confirm PDSCH" in a previously received PHYSICAL SHARED CHANNEL ALLOCATION message and the IE "PUSCH capacity allocation info" is present in this message:
2>	set the CHOICE "Allocation confirmation" to "PDSCH Confirmation" with the value given in the IE "PDSCH Identity" stored in the variable PHYSICAL_SHARED_CHANNEL_CONFIGURATION.
1>	if the initiation of the procedure is triggered by the IE "Confirm request" set to "Confirm PUSCH" in a previously received PHYSICAL SHARED CHANNEL ALLOCATION message:
2>	set the CHOICE "Allocation confirmation" to "PUSCH Confirmation" with the value given in the IE "PUSCH Identity" stored in the variable PHYSICAL_SHARED_CHANNEL_CONFIGURATION.
1>	if the variable PROTOCOL_ERROR_REJECT is set to TRUE:
2>	include the IE "RRC transaction identifier" in the response message transmitted below; and
2>	set it to the value of "RRC transaction identifier" in the entry for the PHYSICAL SHARED CHANNEL ALLOCATION message in the table "Rejected transactions" in the variable TRANSACTIONS; and
2>	clear that entry;
2>	set the IE "protocol error indicator" to TRUE;
2>	include the IE "Protocol error information" with contents set to the value of the variable PROTOCOL_ERROR_INFORMATION.
1>	if the value of the variable PROTOCOL_ERROR_ REJECT is FALSE:
2>	set the IE "Protocol error indicator" to FALSE.
As an option, the message may include IE "Timeslot ISCP" and IE "Primary CCPCH RSCP".
The timeslots for which "Timeslot ISCP" may be reported shall have been configured with a previous PHYSICAL SHARED CHANNEL ALLOCATION message and stored in the variable PHYSICAL_SHARED_CHANNEL_CONFIGURATION.
"Primary CCPCH RSCP" is reported when requested with a previous PHYSICAL SHARED CHANNEL ALLOCATION message.
8.2.8.4	Reception of a PUSCH CAPACITY REQUEST message by the UTRAN
Upon receiving a PUSCH CAPACITY REQUEST message with traffic volume measurement included for at least one radio bearer, the UTRAN should initiate the PHYSICAL SHARED CHANNEL ALLOCATION procedure, either for allocating PUSCH or PDSCH resources as required, or just as an acknowledgement, indicating a pending PUSCH allocation, as described in subclause 8.2.7.
8.2.8.5	T310 expiry
Upon expiry of timer T310, the UE shall:
1>	if V310 is smaller than N310:
2>	transmit a new PUSCH CAPACITY REQUEST message on the Uplink SHCCH;
2>	restart timer T310;
2>	increment counter V310;
2>	set the IEs in the PUSCH CAPACITY REQUEST message as specified in subclause 8.2.8.3.
1>	if V310 is greater than or equal to N310:
2>	the procedure ends.

8.2.10	Uplink Physical Channel Control [TDD only]

Figure 8.2.10-1: Uplink Physical Channel Control
8.2.10.1	General
The uplink physical channel control procedure is used in TDD to control the uplink outer loop power control and timing advance running in the UE.
8.2.10.2	Initiation
The UTRAN initiates the procedure by transmitting the UPLINK PHYSICAL CHANNEL CONTROL message on the downlink DCCH using AM or UM RLC in order to update parameters for uplink open loop power control in the UE for one CCTrCH or to inform the UE about a new timing advance value to be applied. Especially, uplink interference information measured by the UTRAN can be included for the uplink timeslots used for the CCTrCH.
8.2.10.3	Reception of UPLINK PHYSICAL CHANNEL CONTROL message by the UE
Upon reception of the UPLINK PHYSICAL CHANNEL CONTROL message, the UE shall:
1>	act upon all received information elements as specified in subclause 8.6.
In 1.28 Mcps TDD, if the IE "Uplink DPCH Power Control Info" and IE "PRXHS-SICH" and IE "TPC step size" are transmitted, this information shall be taken into account by the UE for uplink open loop power control and for uplink closed loop power control as described in subclause 8.6.6.11, and the"PRXHS-SICH" shall be taken into account by the UE for open loop power control as described in subclause 8.5.7 and the "TPC step size" for closed loop power control on HS-SICH.
In 3.84 Mcps TDD or 7.68 Mcps TDD, if the IEs "Uplink DPCH Power Control Info", "PRACH Constant Value", "PUSCH Constant Value",  "HS-SICH Power Control Info", "Alpha" or IE group "list of UL Timeslot Interference" are transmitted, this information shall be taken into account by the UE for uplink open loop power control as specified in subclause 8.5.7. If the UE is capable of using IPDLs for UE positioning, the IE "IPDL-Alpha" shall be used instead of the IE "Alpha". If the IE "IPDL-Alpha" parameter is not present, the UE shall use IE "Alpha".
If the IE Special Burst Scheduling is transmitted the UE shall:
1>	use the new value for the "Special Burst Generation Period".
The UE shall:
1>	clear the entry for the UPLINK PHYSICAL CHANNEL CONTROL message in the table "Accepted transactions" in the variable TRANSACTIONS;
1>	and the procedure ends.
8.2.10.4	Invalid UPLINK PHYSICAL CHANNEL CONTROL message
If the UE receives a UPLINK PHYSICAL CHANNEL CONTROL message, which contains a protocol error causing the variable PROTOCOL_ERROR_REJECT to be set to TRUE according to clause 9, the UE shall perform procedure specific error handling as follows. The UE shall:
1>	transmit an RRC STATUS message on the uplink DCCH using AM RLC, setting the information elements as specified below:
2>	include the IE "Identification of received message"; and
2>	set the IE "Received message type" to UPLINK PHYSICAL CHANNEL CONTROL; and
2>	set the IE "RRC transaction identifier" to the value of "RRC transaction identifier" in the entry for the UPLINK PHYSICAL CHANNEL CONTROL message in the table "Rejected transactions" in the variable TRANSACTIONS; and
2>	clear that entry;
2>	include the IE "Protocol error information" with contents set to the value of the variable PROTOCOL_ERROR_INFORMATION.
1>	when the RRC STATUS message has been submitted to lower layers for transmission:
2>	continue with any ongoing processes and procedures as if the invalid UPLINK PHYSICAL CHANNEL CONTROL message has not been received.
8.2.11	Physical channel reconfiguration failure

Figure 8.2.11-1: Physical channel reconfiguration failure in case of runtime configuration error
8.2.11.1	General
The physical channel reconfiguration failure procedure is used to indicate to the network a runtime configuration error in the UE.
8.2.11.2	Runtime error due to overlapping compressed mode configurations
When the UE has received from the UTRAN the configurations of several compressed mode transmission gap pattern sequences, and if several of these patterns are to be simultaneously active, the UE shall check to see if these simultaneously active transmission gap pattern sequences create transmission gaps in the same frame. An illegal overlap is created if two or more transmission gap pattern sequences create transmission gaps in the same frame, irrespective of the gaps are created in uplink or downlink.
If the parallel transmission gap pattern sequences create an illegal overlap, the UE shall:
1>	delete the overlapping transmission gap pattern sequence configuration stored in the variable TGPS_IDENTITY, which is associated with the highest value of IE "TGPSI";
1>	transmit a PHYSICAL CHANNEL RECONFIGURATION FAILURE message on the DCCH using AM RLC, setting the information elements as specified below:
2>	not include the IE "RRC transaction identifier";
2>	set the cause value in IE "failure cause" to value "compressed mode runtime error".
1>	terminate the inter-frequency and/or inter-RAT measurements corresponding to the deleted transmission gap pattern sequence;
1>	when the PHYSICAL CHANNEL RECONFIGURATION FAILURE message has been submitted to lower layers for transmission:

Figure 8.3.1-9: URA update procedure with update of UTRAN mobility information

Figure 8.3.1-10: URA update procedure, failure case
8.3.1.1	General
The URA update and cell update procedures serve several main purposes:
-	to notify UTRAN after re-entering service area in the URA_PCH or CELL_PCH state;
-	to notify UTRAN of an RLC unrecoverable error [16] on an AM RLC entity;
-	to be used as a supervision mechanism in the CELL_FACH, CELL_PCH, or URA_PCH state by means of periodical update.
In addition, the URA update procedure also serves the following purpose:
-	to retrieve a new URA identity after cell re-selection to a cell not belonging to the current URA assigned to the UE in URA_PCH state.
In addition, the cell update procedure also serves the following purposes:
-	to update UTRAN with the current cell the UE is camping on after cell reselection;
-	to act on a radio link failure in the CELL_DCH state;
-	to act on the transmission failure of the UE CAPABILITY INFORMATION message;
-	when triggered in the URA_PCH or CELL_PCH state, to notify UTRAN of a transition to the CELL_FACH state due to the reception of UTRAN originated paging or due to a request to transmit uplink data;
-	to count the number of UEs in URA_PCH , CELL_PCH and CELL_FACH that are interested to receive an MBMS transmission;
-	when triggered in the URA_PCH , CELL_PCH and CELL_FACH state, to notify UTRAN of the UEs interest to receive an MBMS service;
-	to request the MBMS P-T-P RB setup by the UE in CELL_PCH, URA_PCH and CELL_FACH state.
The URA update and cell update procedures may:
1>	include an update of mobility related information in the UE;
1>	cause a state transition from the CELL_FACH state to the CELL_DCH, CELL_PCH or URA_PCH states or idle mode.
The cell update procedure may also include:
-	a re-establish of AM RLC entities;
-	a radio bearer release, radio bearer reconfiguration, transport channel reconfiguration or physical channel reconfiguration.

Figure 8.3.3-2: UTRAN mobility information procedure, failure case
8.3.3.1	General
The purpose of this procedure is to allocate any one or a combination of the following to a UE in connected mode:
-	a new C-RNTI;
-	a new U-RNTI;
-	other mobility related information.
8.3.3.2	Initiation
To initiate the procedure UTRAN transmits a UTRAN MOBILITY INFORMATION message to the UE on the downlink DCCH using AM or UM RLC. In case of SRNS relocation, the message is sent using UM RLC only.
8.3.3.3	Reception of UTRAN MOBILITY INFORMATION message by the UE
When the UE receives a UTRAN MOBILITY INFORMATION message, it shall:
1>	act on received information elements as specified in subclause 8.6;
1>	if the IE "UE Timers and constants in connected mode" is present:
2>	store the values of the IE "UE Timers and constants in connected mode" in the variable TIMERS_AND_CONSTANTS, replacing any previously stored value for each timer and constant; and
2>	for each updated timer value:
3>	start using the new value next time the timer is started;
NOTE:	If a new value of timer T305 is included in the IE "UE Timers and constants in connected mode", and the old value of timer T305 is "infinity", the UE will not use the new value of the timer T305 until the next cell reselection.
2>	for each updated constant value:
3>	start using the new value directly;
1>	if the IE "CN domain specific DRX cycle length coefficient" is present:
2>	store the value of the IE "CN domain specific DRX cycle length coefficient" for that CN domain, replacing any previously stored value; and
2>	use the value to determine the connected mode paging occasions according to [4].
1>	set the IE "RRC transaction identifier" in the UTRAN MOBILITY INFORMATION CONFIRM message to the value of "RRC transaction identifier" in the entry for the UTRAN MOBILITY INFORMATION message in the table "Accepted transactions" in the variable TRANSACTIONS; and

2>	re-establish the RLC entity for RB2;
2>	for the downlink and the uplink, apply the ciphering configuration as follows:
3> if the received re-configuation message included the IE "Ciphering Mode Info":
4> use the ciphering configuration in the received message when transmitting the response message.
3>	if the ciphering configuration for RB2 from a previously received SECURITY MODE COMMAND has not yet been applied because the activation times not having been reached:
4>	if the previous SECURITY MODE COMMAND was received due to new keys being received:
5>	consider the new ciphering configuration to include the received new keys;
5>	initialise the HFN component of the uplink COUNT-C and downlink COUNT-C of SRB2 as indicated in subclause 8.1.12.3.1.
4>	else if the ciphering configuration for RB2 from a previously received SECURITY MODE COMMAND has not yet been applied because of the corresponding activation times not having been reached and the previous SECURITY MODE COMMAND caused a change in LATEST_CONFIGURED_CN_DOMAIN:
5>	consider the new ciphering configuration to include the keys associated with the LATEST_CONFIGURED_CN_DOMAIN;
5>	initialise the HFN component of the uplink COUNT-C and downlink COUNT-C of SRB2 to the most recently transmitted IE "START list" or IE "START" for the LATEST_CONFIGURED_CN_DOMAIN at the reception of the previous SECURITY MODE COMMAND.
4>	apply the new ciphering configuration immediately following RLC re-establishment.
3>	else:
4>	continue using the current ciphering configuration.
2>	set the new uplink and downlink HFN component of COUNT-C of RB2 to MAX(uplink HFN component of COUNT-C of RB2, downlink HFN component of COUNT-C of RB2);
2>	increment by one the downlink and uplink values of the HFN component of COUNT-C for RB2;
2>	calculate the START value according to subclause 8.5.9;

3>	re-establish all AM and UM RLC entities with RB identities larger than 4 and set the first 20 bits of all the HFN component of the respective COUNT-C values to the START value included in the response message for the corresponding CN domain;
3>	re-establish the RLC entities with RB identities 1, 3 and 4 and set the first 20 bits of all the HFN component of the respective COUNT-C values to the START value included in the response message for the CN domain stored in the variable LATEST_CONFIGURED_CN_DOMAIN;
3>	set the remaining bits of the HFN component of the COUNT-C values of all UM RLC entities to zero;

8.3.4	Active set update

Figure 8.3.4-1: Active Set Update procedure, successful case

Figure 8.3.4-2: Active Set Update procedure, failure case
8.3.4.1	General
The purpose of the active set update procedure is to update the active set of the connection between the UE and UTRAN. This procedure shall be used in CELL_DCH state. The UE should keep on using the old RLs while configuring the new RLs. Also the UE should keep the transmitter turned on during the procedure. This procedure is only used in FDD mode.
8.3.4.2	Initiation
The procedure is initiated when UTRAN orders a UE in CELL_DCH state, to make the following modifications of the active set of the connection:
a)	Radio link addition;
b)	Radio link removal;
c)	Combined radio link addition and removal; 
d)	Addition of a radio link to the E-DCH active set;
e)	Removal of a radio link from the E-DCH active set.
In case a) and c), UTRAN should:
1>	prepare new additional radio link(s) in the UTRAN prior to the command to the UE.
In all cases, UTRAN should:
1>	send an ACTIVE SET UPDATE message on downlink DCCH using AM or UM RLC;
1>	create active sets that contain at least one common radio link across a DPCH or F-DPCH frame boundary as the result of one or multiple (parallel) active set update procedures.
UTRAN should include the following information:
1>	IE "Radio Link Addition Information": Downlink DPCH information and other optional parameters relevant for the radio links to be added along with the IE "Primary CPICH info" used for the reference ID to indicate which radio link to add. This IE is needed in cases a) and c) listed above;
1>	IE "Radio Link Removal Information": IE "Primary CPICH info" used for the reference ID to indicate which radio link to remove. This IE is needed in cases b) and c) listed above; 
1>	IE "E-DCH reconfiguration information": IE "Primary CPICH info" used for the reference ID along with the IE "E-HICH information" to indicate which radio link to add to the E-DCH active set. This IE is needed in case d) above, when the RL added to the E-DCH active set is already in the DCH active set;
1>	IE "E-DCH reconfiguration information": IE "Primary CPICH info" used for the reference ID along with the IE "E-HICH release indicator" to indicate which radio link to remove from the E-DCH active set. This IE is needed in case e) above, when the RL removed from the E-DCH active set remains in the DCH active set.
8.3.4.3	Reception of an ACTIVE SET UPDATE message by the UE
Upon reception of an ACTIVE SET UPDATE message the UE shall act upon all received information elements as specified in 8.6, unless specified otherwise in the following.
The UE may:
1>	maintain a list of the set of cells to which the UE has Radio Links if the IE "Cell ID" is present.
The UE shall:
1>	first add the RLs indicated in the IE "Radio Link Addition Information";
1>	remove the RLs indicated in the IE "Radio Link Removal Information". If the UE active set is full or becomes full, an RL, which is included in the IE "Radio Link Removal Information" for removal, shall be removed before adding RL, which is included in the IE "Radio Link Addition Information" for addition;
1>	perform the physical layer synchronisation procedure B as specified in [29];
1>	if the IE "E-HICH information" is included:
2>	store this E-HICH configuration for the concerning radio link.
1>	if the IE "E-HICH information" is included:
2>	store this E-RGCH configuration for the concerning radio link, if included.
1>	determine the value for the E_DCH_TRANSMISSION variable and take the corresponding actions as described in subclause 8.5.28;
1>	if the radio link currently considered to be the serving HS-DSCH radio link is indicated in the IE "Radio Link Removal Information":
2>	no longer consider any radio link as the serving HS-DSCH radio link;
2>	determine the value for the HS_DSCH_RECEPTION variable and take the corresponding actions as described in subclause 8.5.25.
1>	if "Serving HS-DSCH cell information" IE is present, act on received information elements as specified in subclause 8.6:

1>	transmit a ACTIVE SET UPDATE FAILURE message on the uplink DCCH using AM RLC;
1>	set the IE "RRC transaction identifier" in the ACTIVE SET UPDATE FAILURE message to the value of "RRC transaction identifier" in the entry for the ACTIVE SET UPDATE message in the table "Accepted transactions" in the variable TRANSACTIONS; and
1>	clear that entry;
1>	set the IE "failure cause" to the cause value "protocol error";

1>	when the ACTIVE SET UPDATE FAILURE message has been delivered to lower layers for transmission:
2>	continue with any ongoing processes and procedures as if the ACTIVE SET UPDATE message has not been received;
2>	and the procedure ends.
8.3.5	Hard handover
When performing hard handover with change of frequency, the UE shall:
1>	stop all intra-frequency and inter-frequency measurement reporting on the cells listed in the variable CELL_INFO_LIST. Each stopped measurement is restarted when a MEASUREMENT CONTROL message is received with the corresponding measurement identity.
8.3.5.1	Timing re-initialised hard handover
8.3.5.1.1	General
The purpose of the timing re-initialised hard handover procedure is to remove all the RL(s) in the active set and establish new RL(s) along with a change in the CFN in the UE according to the SFN of the target cell.(see subclause 8.5.15).
For TDD timing re-initialised hard handover is realised via CFN calculation (see subclause 8.5.15.2).
NOTE:	For FDD, during the hard-handover procedure, the UE will align the timing of the uplink transmission as specified in [26].
This procedure is initiated when UTRAN does not know the target SFN timing before hard handover.
8.3.5.1.2	Initiation (FDD only)
Timing re-initialised hard handover initiated by the UTRAN is normally performed by using the procedure "Physical channel reconfiguration" (subclause 8.2.6), but may also be performed by using either one of the following procedures:
-	"radio bearer establishment" (subclause 8.2.1);
-	"Radio bearer reconfiguration" (subclause 8.2.2);
-	"Radio bearer release" (subclause 8.2.3); or
-	"Transport channel reconfiguration" (subclause 8.2.4).
In this case of a timing re-initialised hard handover, UTRAN should include the IE "Default DPCH Offset Value" and:
1>	in FDD mode:
2>	set "Default DPCH Offset Value" and "DPCH frame offset" respecting the following relation
	(Default DPCH Offset Value) mod 38400 = DPCH frame offsetj
3>	where j indicates the first radio link listed in the message and the IE values used are the Actual Values of the IEs as defined in clause 11.
If the IE "Default DPCH Offset Value" is included, the UE shall:
1>	in FDD mode:
2>	if the above relation between "Default DPCH Offset Value" and "DPCH frame offset" is not respected:
3>	set the variable INVALID_CONFIGURATION to true.
If the IE "Default DPCH Offset Value" is not included, the UE shall:
1>	set the variable INVALID_CONFIGURATION to true.
8.3.5.2	Timing-maintained hard handover
8.3.5.2.1	General
The purpose of the Timing-maintained hard handover procedure is to remove all the RL(s) in the active set and establish new RL(s) while maintaining the CFN in the UE.
For TDD timing re-initialised hard handover is realised via CFN calculation (see subclause 8.5.15.2).
NOTE:	For FDD, during the hard-handover procedure, the UE will align the timing of the uplink transmission as specified in [26].
This procedure can be initiated only if UTRAN knows the target SFN timing before hard handover. The target SFN timing can be known by UTRAN in the following 2 cases:
-	UE reads SFN when measuring "Cell synchronisation information" and sends it to the UTRAN in MEASUREMENT REPORT message.
-	UTRAN internally knows the time difference between the cells.
8.3.5.2.2	Initiation (FDD only)
Timing-maintained hard handover initiated by the network is normally performed by using the procedure "Physical channel reconfiguration" (subclause 8.2.6), but may also be performed by using either one of the following procedures:
-	"radio bearer establishment" (subclause 8.2.1);
-	"Radio bearer reconfiguration" (subclause 8.2.2);
-	"Radio bearer release" (subclause 8.2.3); or
-	"Transport channel reconfiguration" (subclause 8.2.4).
In this case of a timing maintained hard handover procedure the UTRAN should not include the IE "Default DPCH Offset Value".
If the IE "Default DPCH Offset Value" is included, the UE shall:
1>	ignore the IE "Default DPCH Offset Value".
8.3.6	Inter-RAT handover to UTRAN


Figure 8.3.6-1: Inter-RAT handover to UTRAN, successful case
8.3.6.1	General
The purpose of the inter-RAT handover procedure is to, under the control of the network, transfer a connection between the UE and another radio access technology (e.g. GSM) to UTRAN.
This procedure may be used to perform CS handover which applies when there is a signalling connection to the CS domain.
When the UE supports Inter Rat PS handover, this procedure may be used to perform PS handover which applies when the there is only a signalling connection to the PS domain.
This procedure may be used to perform simultaneous CS and PS handover (i.e. DTM Handover) which applies when the are signalling connections to both CS and PS domains.
8.3.6.2	Initiation
The procedure is initiated when a radio access technology other than UTRAN, e.g. GSM, using radio access technology-specific procedures, orders the UE to make a handover to UTRAN.
A Handover to UTRAN command message is sent to the UE via the radio access technology from which inter- RAT handover is performed.
In case UTRAN decides to uses a predefined or default radio configuration that is stored in the UE, it should include the following information in the Handover to UTRAN command message.
-	the IE "New U-RNTI" to be assigned;
-	the IE "Predefined configuration identity", to indicate which pre-defined configuration of RB, transport channel and physical channel parameters shall be used; or
-	the IE "Default configuration mode" and IE "Default configuration identity", to indicate which default configuration of RB, transport channel and physical channel parameters shall be used;
-	PhyCH information elements.
NOTE 1:	When using a predefined or default configuration during handover to UTRAN, UTRAN can only assign values of IEs "New U-RNTI" and "scrambling code" that are within the special subranges defined exclusively for this procedure. UTRAN may re- assign other values after completion of the handover procedure.
NOTE 2:	When using a predefined or default configuration during handover to UTRAN, fewer IEs are signalled; when using this signalling option some parameters e.g. concerning compressed mode, DSCH can not be configured. In this case, the corresponding functionality can not be activated immediately.
NOTE 3:	When using a predefined or default configuration, the HANDOVER TO UTRAN COMMAND should not include more than one radio link. If UTRAN includes more than one radio link in the HANDOVER TO UTRAN COMMAND using a predefined or default configuration, the UE behaviour is unspecified.
In case UTRAN does not use a predefined radio configuration that is stored in the UE, it should include the following information in the Handover to UTRAN command message.
-	the IE "New U-RNTI" to be assigned;
-	the complete set of RB, TrCH and PhyCH information elements to be used.
8.3.6.3	Reception of Handover to UTRAN command message by the UE
The UE shall be able to receive a HANDOVER TO UTRAN COMMAND message and perform an inter-RAT handover, even if no prior UE measurements have been performed on the target UTRAN cell and/or frequency.
The UE shall act upon all received information elements as specified in subclause 8.6, unless specified otherwise in the following.
The UE may:
1>	maintain a list of the set of cells to which the UE has Radio Links if the IE "Cell ID" is present.
The UE shall:
1>	store a U-RNTI value (32 bits), which is derived by the IEs "SRNC identity" (12 bits) and "S-RNTI 2" (10 bits) included in IE "U-RNTI-short". In order to produce a full size U-RNTI value, a full size "S-RNTI" (20 bits) shall be derived by padding the IE "S-RNTI 2" with 10 zero bits in the most significant positions; and
1>	initialise the variable ESTABLISHED_SIGNALLING_CONNECTIONS with the signalling connections that remains after the handover according to the specifications of the source RAT;
1>	initialise the variable UE_CAPABILITIES_TRANSFERRED with the UE capabilities that have been transferred to the network up to the point prior to the handover, if any;
1>	initialise the variable TIMERS_AND_CONSTANTS to the default values and start to use those timer and constants values;
1>	if IE "Specification mode" is set to "Preconfiguration" and IE "Preconfiguration mode" is set to "Predefined configuration":
2>	initiate the radio bearer and transport channel configuration in accordance with the predefined parameters identified by the IE "Predefined configuration identity";
2>	initiate the physical channels in accordance with the predefined parameters identified by the IE "Predefined radio configuration identity" and the received physical channel information elements;
2>	store information about the established radio access bearers and radio bearers according to the IE "Predefined configuration identity"; and
2>	set the IE "RAB Info Post" in the variable ESTABLISHED_RABS and the IE "Re-establishment timer" in the IE "RAB Info" in the variable ESTABLISHED_RABS to "useT314".
1>	if IE "Specification mode" is set to "Preconfiguration" and IE "Preconfiguration mode" is set to "Default configuration":
2>	initiate the radio bearer and transport channel configuration in accordance with the default parameters identified by the IE "Default configuration mode" and IE "Default configuration identity";
2>	initiate the physical channels in accordance with the default parameters identified by the IE "Default configuration mode" and IE "Default configuration identity" and the received physical channel information elements;
NOTE 1:	IE "Default configuration mode" specifies whether the FDD or TDD version of the default configuration shall be used.
2>	set the IE "RAB Info Post" in the variable ESTABLISHED_RABS and the IE "Re-establishment timer" in the IE "RAB Info" in the variable ESTABLISHED_RABS to "useT314".
1>	if IE "Specification mode" is set to "Preconfiguration":
2>	use the following values for parameters that are neither signalled within the HANDOVER TO UTRAN COMMAND message nor included within pre-defined or default configuration:
3>	0 dB for the power offset P Pilot-DPDCH bearer in FDD;
3>	calculate the Default DPCH Offset Value using the following formula:
3>	in FDD:
	Default DPCH Offset Value = (SRNTI 2 mod 600) * 512
3>	in TDD:
	Default DPCH Offset Value = (SRNTI 2 mod 7)
3>	handle the above Default DPCH Offset Value as if an IE with that value was included in the message, as specified in subclause 8.6.6.21.
1>	if IE "Specification mode" is set to "Complete specification":
2>	initiate the radio bearer, transport channel and physical channel configuration in accordance with the received radio bearer, transport channel and physical channel information elements.
1>	perform an open loop estimation to determine the UL transmission power according to subclause 8.5.3;
1>	set the IE "START" for each CN domain, in the IE "START list" in the HANDOVER TO UTRAN COMPLETE message equal to the START value for each CN domain stored in the USIM if the USIM is present, or as stored in the UE for each CN domain if the SIM is present;
NOTE 2:	Keys received while in another RAT are not regarded as "new" (i.e.do not trigger the actions in subclause 8.1.12.3.1) in a subsequent security mode control procedure in UTRAN, irrespective of whether the keys are already being used in the other RAT or not. If the UE has received new keys in the other RAT before handover, then the START values in the USIM (sent in the HANDOVER TO UTRAN COMPLETE message and in the INTER_RAT_HANDOVER_INFO sent to the BSS while in the other RAT) will not reflect the receipt of these new keys
If ciphering has been activated in the other RAT, then during the first security mode control procedure following the Inter-RAT handover to UTRAN procedure, UE activates integrity protection using the integrity key of the same key set as used in the other RAT. The term "used key set" denotes the key set that was stored on USIM/SIM at the last successfully completed RRC Security Mode Control (UTRAN), RR Cipher Mode Control procedure or GMM Authentication and Ciphering procedure (GERAN) after entering connected mode in UTRAN or GERAN. 
If ciphering has not been activated in the other RAT, then. at a subsequent security mode control procedure in UTRAN, UE activates ciphering and/or integrity protection using the key set stored in the USIM/SIM.
1>	set the value of "THRESHOLD" in the variable "START_THRESHOLD" to the 20 MSBs of the value stored in the USIM [50] for the maximum value of START for each CN Domain, or to the default value in [40] if the SIM is present;
1>	if ciphering has been activated in the radio access technology from which inter- RAT handover is performed:
2>	for the CN domain included in the IE "CN domain identity" which is included in the IE "RAB info" of the IE "RAB information to setup", or the CS domain when these IEs are either not present or indicate different CN domains:
3>	set the variable LATEST_CONFIGURED_CN_DOMAIN to the value indicated in the IE "CN domain identity", or to the CS domain when this IE is either not present or different instances indicate different CN domains;
3>	set the 20 MSB of the HFN component of the COUNT-C variable for all radio bearers using RLC-TM and all signalling radio bearers to the "START" value included in the IE "UE security information" in the variable "INTER_RAT_HANDOVER_INFO_TRANSFERRED";
3>	set the remaining LSBs of the HFN component of COUNT-C for all radio bearers using RLC-TM and all signalling radio bearers to zero;
3>	not increment the HFN component of COUNT-C for radio bearers using RLC-TM, i.e. keep the HFN value fixed without incrementing every CFN cycle;
3>	set the CFN component of the COUNT-C variable to the value of the CFN as calculated in subclause 8.5.15;
3>	set the IE "Status" in the variable CIPHERING_STATUS to "Started";
3>	apply the algorithm according to IE "Ciphering Algorithm" with the ciphering key of the key set used in the other RAT prior to handover and apply ciphering immediately upon reception of the HANDOVER TO UTRAN COMMAND.
NOTE 3:	The term "used key set" denotes the key set that was stored on USIM/SIM at the last successfully completed RRC Security Mode Control (UTRAN) or RR Cipher Mode Control procedures (GERAN) after entering connected mode in UTRAN or GERAN.
If ciphering has been activated in the radio access technology from which inter RAT handover is performed, UTRAN should not include the IE "Ciphering mode info" in the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message that starts Integrity protection.
NOTE 4:	DTM Handover is not possible if the IE "specification mode" is set to "Preconfiguration" due to the existence of a single IE "RAB Info".
1>	if ciphering has not been activated in the radio access technology from which inter-RAT handover is performed:
2>	for the CN domain(s) included in the IE "CN domain identity" which is included in the IE "RAB info" of the IE "RAB information to setup", or the CS domain when these IEs are not present:
3>	set the IE "Status" in the variable CIPHERING_STATUS to "Not Started".
If the UE succeeds in establishing the connection to UTRAN, it shall:
1>	if "RAB Info" list contained only one CN domain identity in IE "CN domain identity":
2>	if CN domain is set to CS domain only indicate to upper layers that no CN system information is available for any domain other than the CS domain;
2>	if CN domain is set to PS domain only indicate to upper layers that no CN system information is available for any domain other than the PS domain.
NOTE 5:	After the handover has been completed, the UTRAN should provide the UE with the CN system information of the CN domain to which the UE has no signalling connection as soon as possible, in order not to delay access to that CN domain.
1>	if the USIM or SIM is present:
2>	set the START value stored in the USIM [50] if present, and as stored in the UE if the SIM is present for any CN domain to the value "THRESHOLD" of the variable START_THRESHOLD.
1>	if the IE "Status" in the variable CIPHERING_STATUS of a CN domain is set to "Started" and transparent mode radio bearers have been established by this procedure for that CN domain:
2>	include the IE "COUNT-C activation time" in the response message and specify a CFN value for this IE other than the default, "Now", that is a multiple of 8 frames (CFN mod 8 =0) and lies at least 200 frames ahead of the CFN in which the response message is first transmitted;
2>	at the CFN value as indicated in the response message in the IE "COUNT-C activation time" for radio bearers using RLC-TM:
3>	set the 20 MSB of the HFN component of the COUNT-C variable common for all transparent mode radio bearers of this CN domain to the START value as indicated in the IE "START list" of the response message for the relevant CN domain; and
3>	set the remaining LSBs of the HFN component of COUNT-C to zero;
3>	increment the HFN component of the COUNT-C variable by one even if the "COUNT-C activation time" is equal to zero;
3>	set the CFN component of the COUNT-C to the value of the IE "COUNT-C activation time" of the response message. The HFN component and the CFN component completely initialise the COUNT-C variable;
3>	step the COUNT-C variable, as normal, at each CFN value. The HFN component is no longer fixed in value but incremented at each CFN cycle.
1>	if the IE "Status" in the variable CIPHERING_STATUS of a CN domain is set to "Not Started" and transparent mode radio bearers have been established by this procedure for that CN domain:
2>	initialise the 20 MSB of the HFN component of COUNT-C common for all transparent mode radio bearers of this CN domain with the START value as indicated in the IE "START list" of the response message for the relevant CN domain;
2>	set the remaining LSBs of the HFN component of COUNT-C to zero;
2>	do not increment the COUNT-C value common for all transparent mode radio bearers for this CN domain.
1>	transmit a HANDOVER TO UTRAN COMPLETE message on the uplink DCCH, using, if ciphering has been started, the new ciphering configuration;
1>	when the HANDOVER TO UTRAN COMPLETE message has been submitted to lower layers for transmission:

2>	initialise variables upon entering UTRA RRC connected mode as specified in subclause 13.4;
2>	update the variable UE_CAPABILITY_TRANSFERRED with the UE capabilities stored in the variable INTER_RAT_HANDOVER_INFO_TRANSFERRED;
2>	for all radio bearers using RLC-AM or RLC-UM:
3>	set the 20 MSB of the HFN component of the uplink and downlink COUNT-C variable to the START value indicated in the IE "START list" of the response message for the relevant CN domain; and

3>	increment the HFN component of the COUNT-C variable by one;
3>	start incrementing the COUNT-C values.
1>	and the procedure ends.
8.3.6.4	Invalid Handover to UTRAN command message
If the UE receives a Handover to UTRAN command message, which contains a protocol error causing the variable PROTOCOL_ERROR_REJECT to be set to TRUE according to clause 9, the UE shall perform procedure specific error handling according to the source radio access technology. The UE shall:
1>	if allowed by the source RAT:
2>	transmit an RRC FAILURE INFO message to the source radio access technology; and
2>	include the IE "Protocol error information" with contents set to the value of the variable PROTOCOL_ERROR_INFORMATION;
1>	Other details may be provided in the specifications related to the source radio access technology.
NOTE:	The other RAT may include the above diagnostics information in a subsequent handover request towards the same RNC.
8.3.6.4a	Unsupported configuration in HANDOVER TO UTRAN COMMAND message
If the UE does not support the configuration included in the HANDOVER TO UTRAN COMMAND message, e.g., the message includes a pre-defined configuration that the UE has not stored, the UE shall:
1>	continue the connection using the other radio access technology; and
1>	indicate the failure to the other radio access technology.
8.3.6.5	UE fails to perform handover
If the UE does not succeed in establishing the connection to UTRAN, it shall:
1>	terminate the procedure including release of the associated resources;
1>	resume the connection used before the handover; and
1>	indicate the failure to the other radio access technology.
Upon receiving an indication about the failure from the other radio access technology, UTRAN should release the associated resources and the context information concerning this UE.
8.3.6.6	Reception of message HANDOVER TO UTRAN COMPLETE by the UTRAN
Upon receiving a HANDOVER TO UTRAN COMPLETE message, UTRAN should consider the inter-RAT handover procedure as having been completed successfully and indicate this to the Core Network.
8.3.7	Inter-RAT handover from UTRAN

Figure 8.3.7-1: Inter-RAT handover from UTRAN, successful case

Figure 8.3.7-2: Inter-RAT handover from UTRAN, failure case
8.3.7.1	General
The purpose of the inter-RAT handover procedure is to, under the control of the network, transfer a connection between the UE and UTRAN to another radio access technology (e.g. GSM). This procedure may be used in CELL_DCH state. 
This procedure may be used to perform CS handover which applies when the variable ESTABLISHED_SIGNALLING_CONNECTIONS includes at least the CN domain identity "CS Domain".
When the UE supports Inter Rat PS handover, this procedure may be used to perform PS handover which applies when the variable ESTABLISHED_SIGNALLING_CONNECTIONS includes at least the CN domain identity "PS Domain".
This procedure may be used to perform simultaneous CS and PS handover which applies when the variable ESTABLISHED_SIGNALLING_CONNECTIONS includes CN domain identities for both "CS Domain" and "PS Domain".
8.3.7.2	Initiation
The procedure is initiated when UTRAN orders a UE in CELL_DCH state, to make a handover to a radio access technology other than UTRAN, e.g. GSM.
To initiate the procedure, UTRAN sends a HANDOVER FROM UTRAN COMMAND message.
8.3.7.3	Reception of a HANDOVER FROM UTRAN COMMAND message by the UE
The UE shall be able to receive a HANDOVER FROM UTRAN COMMAND message and perform an inter-RAT handover, even if no prior UE measurements have been performed on the target cell.
The UE shall:
1>	For FDD: 
2>	if the UE has a pending "TGPS reconfiguration CFN" at the activation time received in the HANDOVER FROM UTRAN COMMAND the UE may:
3>	abort the pending CM activation;
3>	set the CM_PATTERN_ACTIVATION_ABORTED to TRUE.
2>	otherwise:
3>	set the CM_PATTERN_ACTIVATION_ABORTED to FALSE.
1>	establish the connection to the target radio access technology, by using the contents of the IE "Inter-RAT message". This IE contains a message specified in another standard, as indicated by the IE "System type", and carries information about the candidate/ target cell identifier(s) and radio parameters relevant for the target radio access technology. The correspondence between the value of the IE "System type", the standard to apply and the message contained within IE "Inter RAT message" is shown in the following:

4>	use the contents of the IE "GERAN system information" as the system information to begin access on the target GERAN cell.
NOTE1:	In this version of the specification the maximum number of CS domain RABs which may be included in the IE "RAB information List" is limited to 1.
NOTE2:	In handover to GERAN Iu mode, the RAB information is included in the RADIO BEARER RECONFIGURATION message specified in [53].
NOTE3:	Requirements concerning the establishment of the radio connection towards the other radio access technology and the signalling procedure are outside the scope of this specification.
NOTE4:	The UE may ignore the IE "NAS synchronisation indicator" if included in the HANDOVER FROM UTRAN COMMAND message;
NOTE5:	The UE behaviour is undefined if the IE "Re-establishment timer" in the IE "RAB info" indicates a timer different from the timer currently configured for this RAB.
NOTE6:	The IE "GERAN System Information" is constructed in the same way as in 2G to 2G PS Handover in [44].
8.3.7.4	Successful completion of the inter-RAT handover
Upon successfully completing the handover, UTRAN should:
1>	release the radio connection; and
1>	remove all context information for the concerned UE.
Upon successfully completing the handover, the UE shall:
1>	if inter-RAT handover to GERAN Iu mode is performed:

8.3.8	Inter-RAT cell reselection to UTRAN
8.3.8.1	General
The purpose of the inter-RAT cell reselection procedure to UTRAN is to transfer, under the control of the UE and to some extent the source radio access technology, a connection between the UE and another radio access technology (e.g. GSM/GPRS, but not UTRAN) to UTRAN.
8.3.8.2	Initiation
When the UE makes an inter-RAT cell reselection to UTRAN according to the criteria specified in [4], it shall initiate this procedure. The inter-RAT cell reselection made by the UE may use system information broadcast from the source radio access technology or UE dedicated information.

1>	initialise the variable TIMERS_AND_CONSTANTS to the default values and start to use those timer and constants values.
8.3.8.3	UE fails to complete an inter-RAT cell reselection
If the inter-RAT cell reselection fails before the UE has initiated the RRC connection establishment the UE may return back to the other radio access technology.
If the RRC connection establishment fails, the UE shall enter idle mode.
8.3.8.3a	UE fails to complete an inter-RAT cell reselection from GERAN Iu mode
When the UE performs an inter-RAT cell reselection from GERAN Iu mode to UTRAN, and the cell reselection fails:
1>	the UE may return back to the GERAN Iu mode state from which it initiated the inter-RAT cell reselection.
8.3.9	Inter-RAT cell reselection from UTRAN
8.3.9.1	General
The purpose of the inter-RAT cell reselection procedure from UTRAN is to transfer, under the control of the UE and to some extent the UTRAN, a connection between the UE and UTRAN to another radio access technology (e.g. GSM/GPRS).
8.3.9.2	Initiation
This procedure is applicable in states CELL_FACH, CELL_PCH or URA_PCH.
When the UE based on received system information makes a cell reselection to a radio access technology other than UTRAN, e.g. GSM/GPRS, according to the criteria specified in [4], the UE shall:
1>	If the NAS procedures associated with inter-system change specified in [5] require the establishment of a connection:
2>	initiate the establishment of a connection to the target radio access technology according to its specifications.
8.3.9.2a	Initiation of inter-RAT cell reselection to GERAN Iu mode
When the UE in CELL_PCH or CELL_FACH state performs an inter-RAT cell reselection to GERAN Iu mode, according to the criteria specified in [4], the UE shall:
1>	initiate the cell update procedure according to 3GPP TS 44.118 [53], setting the U-RNTI in the IE "G-RNTI".
When the UE in URA_PCH state performs an  inter-RAT cell reselection to GERAN Iu mode, according to the criteria specified in [4], the UE shall:
1>	compare the URA identity which the UE had been assigned to in UTRAN against the GRA identities which are broadcast in the GERAN cell;
1>	If the assigned URA identity is not present in the list of GRA identities that are broadcast in the GERAN cell:
2>	initiate the GRA update procedure as specified in 3GPP TS 44.118 [53], setting the U-RNTI in the IE "G-RNTI".
8.3.9.3	Successful cell reselection
When the UE has succeeded in reselecting a cell in the target radio access technology, the UE shall:

1>	release all UTRAN specific resources.
UTRAN should:
1>	release all UE dedicated resources upon indication that the UE has completed a connection establishment to the other radio access technology.
8.3.9.4	UE fails to complete an inter-RAT cell reselection
If the inter-RAT cell reselection fails, the UE shall:
1>	resume the connection to UTRAN using the resources used before initiating the inter-RAT cell reselection procedure.
8.3.10	Inter-RAT cell change order to UTRAN
8.3.10.1	General
The purpose of the inter-RAT cell change order to UTRAN procedure is to transfer, under the control of the source radio access technology, a connection between the UE and another radio access technology (e.g. GSM/GPRS) to UTRAN.
8.3.10.2	Initiation
The procedure is initiated when a radio access technology other than UTRAN, e.g. GSM/GPRS, using procedures specific for that RAT, orders the UE to change to a UTRAN cell.
NOTE:	Within the message used to order the UE to change to a UTRAN cell, the source RAT should specify the identity of the target UTRAN cell as specified in the specifications for that RAT.
The UE shall:
1>	set the variable ESTABLISHMENT_CAUSE to "Inter-RAT cell change order";
NOTE:	This value of ESTABLISHMENT_CAUSE has priority over the cause requested by upper layers.
1>	initiate an RRC connection establishment procedure as specified in subclause 8.1.3.
8.3.10.3	UE fails to complete an inter-RAT cell change order
If the inter-RAT cell reselection fails the UE shall return to the other radio access technology and proceed as specified in the appropriate specifications for that RAT.
NOTE 3:	The cell change was network ordered. Therefore, failure to change to the target cell should not cause the UE to move to UE- controlled cell selection.
8.3.11	Inter-RAT cell change order from UTRAN

Figure 8.3.11-1: Inter–RAT cell change order from UTRAN

Figure 8.3.11-2: Inter-RAT cell change order from UTRAN, failure case
8.3.11.1	General
The purpose of the inter-RAT cell change order procedure is to transfer, under the control of the network, a connection between the UE and UTRAN to another radio access technology (e.g. GSM). This procedure may be used in CELL_DCH and CELL_FACH state. This procedure may be used when no RABs are established or when the established RABs are only from PS domain. This procedure may not be used when there is no PS signalling connection.
8.3.11.2	Initiation
The procedure is initiated when UTRAN orders a UE in CELL_DCH or CELL_FACH state, to make a cell change to a radio access technology other than UTRAN, e.g. GSM.
To initiate the procedure, UTRAN sends a CELL CHANGE ORDER FROM UTRAN message.
8.3.11.3	Reception of an CELL CHANGE ORDER FROM UTRAN message by the UE
The UE shall be able to receive a CELL CHANGE ORDER FROM UTRAN message and perform a cell change order to another RAT, even if no prior UE measurements have been performed on the target cell.
If the variable ESTABLISHED_SIGNALLING_CONNECTIONS does not include the CN domain identity "PS domain", or if the variable ESTABLISHED_SIGNALLING_CONNECTIONS includes the CN domain identity "CS domain":
1>	the UE shall act as if the message was never received.
The UE shall:
1>	For FDD:
2>	if the UE has a pending "TGPS reconfiguration CFN" at the activation time received in the CELL CHANGE ORDER FROM UTRAN message the UE may:
3>	abort the pending CM activation;
3>	set the CM_PATTERN_ACTIVATION_ABORTED to TRUE.
2>	otherwise:
3>	set the CM_PATTERN_ACTIVATION_ABORTED to FALSE.
1>	start timer T309; and
1>	establish the connection to the other radio access technology, as specified within IE "Target cell description". This IE specifies the target cell identity, in accordance with the specifications for that other RAT. In case the target cell is a GSM/ GPRS cell, IE "Target cell description" may also include IE "NC mode", which specifies the cell selection mode to be applied in the target cell; and
1>	if IE "NC mode" is not included in the CELL CHANGE ORDER FROM UTRAN:
2>	retrieve it from the target cell as specified in [43];
2>	act upon IE "NC mode" as specified in [43].
1>	if the IE "RAB Information List" is included in the CELL CHANGE ORDER FROM UTRAN message:
2>	ignore the contents of the IE "RAB Information List".
NOTE:	Requirements concerning the establishment of the radio connection towards the other radio access technology and the signalling procedure are outside the scope of this specification. In case of GSM/GPRS proceed according to the procedure Network control cell reselection procedure as specified in [44].
1> if the UE supports UTRAN to GERAN Network Assisted Cell Change, the IE "Geran System Information" is present and the UE is in CELL_DCH state:
2>	if according to [44] the IE "GERAN System Information" includes a correct and consistent set of SI or PSI messages:
3>	use this information as the system information to begin access on the target GERAN cell.
2>	otherwise:
3>	ignore the IE "GERAN System Information" and continue the Cell Change Order procedure.
NOTE:	The IE "GERAN System Information" is constructed in the same way as in 2G to 2G NACC, i.e. the PSI messages are encoded as such, whereas the SI messages exclude 2 octets of headers, see [44].
8.3.11.4	Successful completion of the cell change order
The UE regards the procedure as completed when it has received a successful response from the target RAT, e.g. in case of GSM when it received the response to a (PACKET) CHANNEL REQUEST in the new cell.
Upon successful completion of the cell change order, the UE shall:
1>	stop timer T309;
1>	clear or set variables upon leaving UTRA RRC connected mode as specified in subclause 13.4.
Upon indication of the UE having successfully completed the cell change order, UTRAN should:
1>	release the radio connection; and
1>	remove all context information for the concerned UE.
NOTE:	The release of the UMTS radio resources is initiated from another RAT.
8.3.11.5	Expiry of timer T309 or UE fails to complete requested cell change order
If:
-	timer T309 expires prior to the successful establishment of a connection to the target RAT; or
-	if the establishment of the connection to the other RAT failed due to other reasons e.g. (random) access failure, rejection due to lack of resources:
the UE shall:
1>	if it received the CELL CHANGE ORDER FROM UTRAN message in state CELL_DCH:
2>	For TDD or for FDD if the CM_PATTERN_ACTIVATION_ABORTED flag is not set to TRUE:
3>	revert back to the UTRA configuration;
3>	establish the UTRA physical channel(s) (including HS-DSCH and E-DCH related channels) used at the time for reception of CELL CHANGE ORDER FROM UTRAN.
2>	For FDD:
3>	perform the physical layer synchronisation procedure A as specified in [29];
3>	apply power control preamble according to [26] during the number of frames indicated in the IE "PC preamble" in the variable LATEST_CONFIGURED_SRB_DELAY_AND_PC_PREAMBLE; and
3>	then not send any data on signalling radio bearers RB0 to RB4 during the number of frames indicated in the IE "SRB delay" in the variable LATEST_CONFIGURED_SRB_DELAY_AND_PC_PREAMBLE or while the physical channel is not considered established;
3>	if the CM_PATTERN_ACTIVATION_ABORTED flag is set to TRUE or if the UE does not succeed in establishing the UTRA physical channel(s):
4>	perform a cell update procedure according to subclause 8.3.1 with cause "Radio link failure";
4>	when the cell update procedure has completed successfully:
5>	proceed as below.
3>	transmit the CELL CHANGE ORDER FROM UTRAN FAILURE message setting the information elements as specified below:
4>	include the IE "RRC transaction identifier"; and
4>	set it to the value of "RRC transaction identifier" in the entry for the received message in the table "Accepted transactions" in the variable TRANSACTIONS; and
4>	clear that entry;
4>	set the IE "Inter-RAT change failure" to "physical channel failure".
3>	When the CELL CHANGE ORDER FROM UTRAN FAILURE message has been submitted to lower layer for transmission, the procedure ends.
1>	if the UE receives the CELL CHANGE ORDER FROM UTRAN message in CELL_FACH state:
2>	revert to the cell it was camped on at the reception of the CELL CHANGE ORDER FROM UTRAN message;
2>	if the UE is unable to return to this cell:
3>	select a suitable UTRA cell according to [4];
3>	initiate the cell update procedure according to subclause 8.3.1 using the cause "cell re-selection";
3>	when the cell update procedure completed successfully:
4>	proceed as below.
2>	transmit the CELL CHANGE ORDER FROM UTRAN FAILURE message setting the information elements as specified below:
3>	include the IE "RRC transaction identifier"; and
3>	set it to the value of "RRC transaction identifier" in the entry for the CELL CHANGE ORDER FROM UTRAN message in the table "Accepted transactions" in the variable TRANSACTIONS; and
3>	clear that entry;
3>	set the IE "Inter-RAT change failure" to "physical channel failure".
2>	When the CELL CHANGE ORDER FROM UTRAN FAILURE message has been submitted to lower layer for transmission:
3>	the procedure ends.
8.3.11.6	Unsupported configuration in CELL CHANGE ORDER FROM UTRAN message
If the UTRAN instructs the UE to perform a non-supported cell change order scenario or to use a non-supported configuration, the UE shall:
1>	transmit a CELL CHANGE ORDER FROM UTRAN FAILURE message, setting the information elements as specified below:
2>	include the IE "RRC transaction identifier"; and
2>	set it to the value of "RRC transaction identifier" in the entry for the received message in the table "Accepted transactions" in the variable TRANSACTIONS; and
2>	clear that entry;
2>	set the IE "Inter-RAT change failure" to "configuration unacceptable";
2>	when the CELL CHANGE ORDER FROM UTRAN FAILURE message has been submitted to lower layers for transmission:
3>	resume normal operation as if the CELL CHANGE ORDER FROM UTRAN message has not been received;
3>	and the procedure ends.
8.3.11.7	Invalid CELL CHANGE ORDER FROM UTRAN message
If the CELL CHANGE ORDER FROM UTRAN message contains a protocol error causing the variable PROTOCOL_ERROR_REJECT to be set to TRUE according to clause 9, the UE shall perform procedure specific error handling as follows. The UE shall:
1>	set the IE "RRC transaction identifier" in the CELL CHANGE ORDER FROM UTRAN FAILURE message to the value of "RRC transaction identifier" in the entry for the CELL CHANGE ORDER FROM UTRAN message in the table "Rejected transactions" in the variable TRANSACTIONS; and
1>	clear that entry;
1>	set the IE "Inter-RAT change failure" to the cause value "protocol error";
1>	include the IE "Protocol error information" with contents set to the value of the variable PROTOCOL_ERROR_INFORMATION;
1>	transmit a CELL CHANGE ORDER FROM UTRAN FAILURE message on the uplink DCCH using AM RLC;
1>	when the CELL CHANGE ORDER FROM UTRAN FAILURE message has been submitted to lower layers for transmission:
2>	resume normal operation as if the invalid CELL CHANGE ORDER FROM UTRAN message has not been received;
2>	and the procedure ends.
8.4	Measurement procedures
8.4.0	Measurement related definitions
UTRAN may control a measurement in the UE either by broadcast of SYSTEM INFORMATION and/or by transmitting a MEASUREMENT CONTROL message.
The following information is used to control the UE measurements and the measurement results reporting:
1.	Measurement identity: A reference number that should be used by the UTRAN when setting up, modifying or releasing the measurement and by the UE in the measurement report.
2.	Measurement command: One out of three different measurement commands.
-	Setup: Setup a new measurement.
-	Modify: Modify a previously defined measurement, e.g. to change the reporting criteria.
-	Release: Stop a measurement and clear all information in the UE that are related to that measurement.
3.	Measurement type: One of the types listed below describing what the UE shall measure.
Presence or absence of the following control information depends on the measurement type
4.	Measurement objects: The objects on which the UE shall measure measurement quantities, and corresponding object information.
5.	Measurement quantity: The quantity the UE shall measure on the measurement object. This also includes the filtering of the measurements.
6.	Reporting quantities: The quantities the UE shall include in the report in addition to the quantities that are mandatory to report for the specific event.
7.	Measurement reporting criteria: The triggering of the measurement report, e.g. periodical or event-triggered reporting.
8.	Measurement Validity: Defines in which UE states the measurement is valid.
9.	Measurement reporting mode: This specifies whether the UE shall transmit the measurement report using AM or UM RLC.
10.	Additional measurement identities: A list of references to other measurements. When this measurement triggers a measurement report, the UE shall also include the reporting quantities for the measurements referenced by the additional measurement identities.
All these measurement parameters depend on the measurement type and are described in more detail in clause 14.
The different types of measurements are:
-	Intra-frequency measurements: measurements on downlink physical channels at the same frequency as the active set. A measurement object corresponds to one cell. Detailed description is found in subclause 14.1.
-	Inter-frequency measurements: measurements on downlink physical channels at frequencies that differ from the frequency of the active set and on downlink physical channels in the active set. A measurement object corresponds to one cell. Detailed description is found in subclause 14.2.
-	Inter-RAT measurements: measurements on downlink physical channels belonging to another radio access technology than UTRAN, e.g. GSM. A measurement object corresponds to one cell. Detailed description is found in subclause 14.3.
-	Traffic volume measurements: measurements on uplink traffic volume. A measurement object corresponds to one cell. Detailed description is found in subclause 14.4.
-	Quality measurements: Measurements of downlink quality parameters, e.g. downlink transport block error rate. A measurement object corresponds to one transport channel in case of BLER. A measurement object corresponds to one timeslot in case of SIR (TDD only). Detailed description is found in subclause 14.5.
-	UE-internal measurements: Measurements of UE transmission power and UE received signal level. Detailed description is found in subclause 14.6.
-	UE positioning measurements: Measurements of UE position. Detailed description is found in subclause 14.7.
The UE shall support a number of measurements running in parallel as specified in [19] and [20]. The UE shall also support that each measurement is controlled and reported independently of every other measurement.
Cells that the UE is monitoring are grouped in the UE into three mutually exclusive categories:
1.	Cells, which belong to the active set. User information is sent from all these cells. In FDD, the cells in the active set are involved in soft handover. In TDD the active set always comprises one cell only. The UE shall only consider active set cells included in the variable CELL_INFO_LIST for measurement; i.e. active set cells not included in the CELL_INFO_LIST shall not be considered in any event evaluation and measurement reporting.
2.	Cells, which are not included in the active set, but are included in the CELL_INFO_LIST belong to the monitored set.
3.	Cells detected by the UE, which are neither in the CELL_INFO_LIST nor in the active set belong to the detected set. Reporting of measurements of the detected set is only applicable to intra-frequency measurements made by UEs in CELL_DCH state.
If the IE "Cells for measurement" has been included in a MEASUREMENT CONTROL message, only monitored set cells explicitly indicated for a given intra-frequency (resp. inter-frequency, interRAT) measurement by the IE "Cells for measurement" shall be considered for measurement. If the IE "Cells for measurement" has not been included in a MEASUREMENT CONTROL message, all of the intra-frequency (resp. inter-frequency, inter RAT) cells stored in the variable CELL_INFO_LIST shall be considered for measurement. The IE "Cells for measurement" is not applicable to active set cells e.g. when the triggering condition refers to active set cells, the UE shall consider all active set cells in the CELL_INFO_LIST for measurement irrespective if these cells are explicitly indicated by the IE "Cells for measurement".
8.4.1	Measurement control

Figure 8.4.1-1: Measurement Control, normal case

Figure 8.4.1-2: Measurement Control, failure case
8.4.1.1	General
The purpose of the measurement control procedure is to setup, modify or release a measurement in the UE.
In subclause 8.4.1 and its subclauses references to System Information Block type 11 mean the merge of System Information Block Type 11 and System Information Block type 11bis, if scheduled on BCH.
8.4.1.2	Initiation
The UTRAN may request a measurement by the UE to be setup, modified or released with a MEASUREMENT CONTROL message, which is transmitted on the downlink DCCH using AM RLC.
The UTRAN should take the UE capabilities into account when a measurement is requested from the UE.
When a new measurement is created, UTRAN should set the IE "Measurement identity" to a value, which is not used for other measurements. UTRAN may use several "Measurement identity" for the same "Measurement type". In case of setting several "Measurement identity" within a same "Measurement type", the measurement object or the list of measurement objects can be set differently for each measurement with different "Measurement identity ".
When a current measurement is modified or released, UTRAN should set the IE "Measurement identity" to the value, which is used for the measurement being modified or released. In case of modifying IEs within a "Measurement identity", it is not needed for UTRAN to indicate the IEs other than modified IEs, and the UE continues to use the current values of the IEs that are not modified. UTRAN should not use "modify" to change the type of measurement stored in the variable MEASUREMENT_IDENTITY for a given measurement identity.
8.4.1.3	Reception of MEASUREMENT CONTROL by the UE
Upon reception of a MEASUREMENT CONTROL message the UE shall perform actions specified in subclause 8.6 unless otherwise specified below.

4>	deactivate this pattern sequence at the beginning of the frame indicated by IE "TGPS reconfiguration CFN" received in the message.
NOTE1:	The temporary deactivation of pattern sequences for which the status flag is set to "activate" can be used by the network to align the timing of already active patterns with newly activated patterns.
NOTE2:	The deactivation of pattern sequences only occurs as a result of RRC messages received by the UE, i.e. the UE does not set the "Current TGPS Status Flag" to "inactive" after the final gap of a finite length pattern sequence.

4>	start the concerned pattern sequence immediately at that CFN.
2>	not alter pattern sequences stored in variable TGPS_IDENTITY, if the pattern sequence is not identitifed in IE "TGPSI" in the received message.
1>	if the UE in CELL_FACH state receives a MEASUREMENT CONTROL message, which indicates the same measurement identity as that stored in the variable MEASUREMENT_IDENTITY:
2>	update the stored information with the traffic volume measurement control information in variable MEASUREMENT_IDENTITY; and
2>	refrain from updating the traffic volume measurement control information associated with this measurement identity in the variable MEASUREMENT_IDENTITY with the information received in System Information Block type 12 (or System Information Block type 11, according to subclause 8.1.1.6.11) until this measurement is explicitly released with another MEASUREMENT CONTROL message.
1>	if the IE "Read SFN indicator" included in the IE "Cell info" of an inter-frequency cell is set to TRUE and the variable UE_CAPABILITY_TRANSFERRED has the DL "Measurement capability" for "FDD measurements" set to TRUE (the UE requires DL compressed mode in order to perform measurements on FDD):
2>	set the variable CONFIGURATION_INCOMPLETE to TRUE.
1>	clear the entry for the MEASUREMENT CONTROL message in the table "Accepted transactions" in the variable TRANSACTIONS.
The UE may:
1>	if the IE "Measurement command" has the value "setup":

Figure 8.4.2-1: Measurement report, normal case
8.4.2.1	General
The purpose of the measurement reporting procedure is to transfer measurement results from the UE to UTRAN.
8.4.2.2	Initiation
In CELL_DCH state, the UE shall:
1>	transmit a MEASUREMENT REPORT message on the uplink DCCH when the reporting criteria stored in variable MEASUREMENT_IDENTITY are met for any ongoing measurements that are being performed in the UE.
In CELL_FACH state, the UE shall:
1>	transmit a MEASUREMENT REPORT message on the uplink DCCH when the reporting criteria stored in variable MEASUREMENT_IDENTITY are met for any ongoing traffic volume measurement or UE positioning measurement that is being performed in the UE.
In TDD, if the Radio Bearer associated with the MEASUREMENT_IDENTITY fulfilling the reporting criteria for an ongoing traffic volume measurement is mapped on transport channel of type USCH, the UE shall:
1>	initiate the "PUSCH CAPACITY REQUEST" procedure instead of transmitting a MEASUREMENT REPORT (TDD Only).
In CELL_PCH or URA_PCH state, the UE shall:
1>	first perform the cell update procedure according to subclause 8.3.1, using the cause "uplink data transmission", in order to transit to CELL_FACH state; and then
1>	transmit a MEASUREMENT REPORT message on the uplink DCCH when the reporting criteria stored in variable MEASUREMENT_IDENTITY are fulfilled for any ongoing UE positioning measurement which is being performed in the UE.
The reporting criteria are fulfilled if either:
-	a periodic MEASUREMENT REPORT message shall be sent according to the IE "Periodical Reporting Criteria"; or
-	an event in stored IE "Measurement reporting criteria" was triggered. Events and triggering of reports for different measurement types are described in detail in clause 14.
For the measurement, which triggered the MEASUREMENT REPORT message, the UE shall:
1>	set the IE "measurement identity" to the measurement identity, which is associated with that measurement in variable MEASUREMENT_IDENTITY;
1>	set the IE "measured results" to include measurements according to the IE "reporting quantity" of that measurement stored in variable MEASUREMENT_IDENTITY; and
2>	if all the reporting quantities are set to "false":
3>	not set the IE "measured results".
1>	set the IE "Measured results" in the IE "Additional measured results" according to the IE "reporting quantity" for all measurements associated with the measurement identities included in the "Additional measurements list" stored in variable MEASUREMENT_IDENTITY of the measurement that triggered the measurement report; and
2>	if one or more additional measured results are to be included:
3>	include only the available additional measured results, and sort them in ascending order according to their IE "measurement identity" in the MEASUREMENT REPORT message.
1>	if the MEASUREMENT REPORT message was triggered by an event (i.e. not a periodical report):
2>	set the IE "Event results" according to the event that triggered the report.
1>	if the IE Inter-RAT measured results list or the IE Inter-RAT measurement event results is included in the measurement report:
2>	if the indication status of the IE "Inter-RAT cell info indication" in the variable CELL_INFO_LIST is marked "present" , include the stored value of the IE "Inter-RAT cell info indication" in the MEASUREMENT REPORT message.
The UE shall:
1>	transmit the MEASUREMENT REPORT message on the uplink DCCH using either AM or UM RLC according to the stored IE "measurement reporting mode" associated with the measurement identity that triggered the report.
When the MEASUREMENT REPORT message has been submitted to lower layers for transmission:
1>	the procedure ends.
8.4.3	Assistance Data Delivery

Figure 8.4.3-1 Assistance Data Delivery
8.4.3.1	General
The purpose of the assistance data delivery procedure is to transfer UE positioning related assistance data from the UTRAN to the UE.
8.4.3.2	Initiation
When requested by the Core Network, the UTRAN may deliver UE positioning related assistance data with a ASSISTANCE DATA DELIVERY message, which is transmitted on the downlink DCCH using AM RLC
8.4.3.3	Reception of ASSISTANCE DATA DELIVERY message by the UE
Upon reception of a ASSISTANCE DATA DELIVERY message the UE shall:
1>	if IE "UE positioning OTDOA assistance data for UE-based" is included:
2>	act as specified in subclause 8.6.7.19.2a.
1>	if IE "UE positioning GPS assistance data" is included:
2>	act as specified in subclause 8.6.7.19.3.
8.4.3.4	Invalid ASSISTANCE DATA DELIVERY message
If the UE receives a ASSISTANCE DATA DELIVERY message, which contains a protocol error causing the variable PROTOCOL_ERROR_REJECT to be set to TRUE according to clause 9, the UE shall perform procedure specific error handling as follows. The UE shall:
1>	transmit an RRC STATUS message on the uplink DCCH using AM RLC;
1>	include the IE "Identification of received message"; and
1>	set the IE "Received message type" to ASSISTANCE DATA DELIVERY; and
1>	set the IE "RRC transaction identifier" to the value of "RRC transaction identifier" in the entry for the ASSISTANCE DATA DELIVERY message in the table "Rejected transactions" in the variable TRANSACTIONS; and
1>	clear that entry;
1>	include the IE "Protocol error information" with contents set to the value of the variable PROTOCOL_ERROR_INFORMATION.
1>	when the RRC STATUS message has been submitted to lower layers for transmission:
2>	continue with any ongoing processes and procedures as if the invalid ASSISTANCE DATA DELIVERY message has not been received.
8.5	General procedures
8.5.1	Selection of initial UE identity
The purpose of the IE "Initial UE identity" is to provide a unique UE identification at the establishment of an RRC connection. The type of identity shall be selected by the UE according to the following.

8.5.8	Maintenance of Hyper Frame Numbers
The MSBs of both the ciphering sequence numbers (COUNT-C) and integrity sequence numbers (COUNT-I), for the ciphering and integrity protection algorithms, respectively [40], are called the Hyper Frame Numbers (HFN).
For integrity protection, the UE shall:
1>	maintain COUNT-I as specified in subclause 8.5.10.
The following hyper frame numbers types are defined:
	MAC-d HFN:
24 MSB of COUNT-C for data sent over RLC TM
	RLC UM HFN:
25 MSB of COUNT-C for data sent over RLC UM
	RLC AM HFN:
20 MSB of COUNT-C for data sent over RLC AM
	RRC HFN:
28 MSB of COUNT-I
For non-transparent mode RLC signalling radio bearers and radio bearers, the UE shall:
1>	maintain one uplink and one downlink COUNT-C per signalling radio bearer and per radio bearer and one uplink and one downlink COUNT-I per signalling radio bearer;
1>	increment the RLC UM HFN and RLC AM HFN in uplink and downlink by one each time the RLC sequence number wraps around in uplink and downlink respectively;
1>	if the activation time for a new ciphering configuration set by an RRC procedure is equal to zero:
2>	apply the configured RLC UM HFN or RLC AM HFN at this activation time, i.e. the configured HFN is not incremented.
NOTE:	On the receiver side it may happen that the RLC PDU with sequence number equal to the activation time is lost and the first received PDU after the activation time implies a wrap around of the sequence number compared to the activation time. In this case the configured HFN is incremented by one. This action is taken only when the activation time is set to a RLC PDU sequence number value other than zero.
For all transparent mode RLC signalling radio bearers and radio bearers of each CN domain, the UE shall:
1>	maintain one COUNT-C, common for all radio bearers in uplink and downlink;
1>	increment the MAC-d HFN by one each time the CFN wraps around;
1>	if the activation time for a new ciphering configuration set by an RRC procedure is equal to zero:
2>	apply the configured MAC-d HFN at this activation time, i.e. the configured HFN is not incremented.
1>	maintain one uplink and one downlink COUNT-I per signalling radio bearer.
NOTE:	In this release of the specification there is only an uplink transparent mode COUNT-I, which is used for signalling radio bearer RB0.
COUNT-C and COUNT-I are defined in [40], with the following supplement for COUNT-C: for transparent mode RLC radio bearers with a transmission time interval of x radio frames (x = 2, 4, 8), the MAC PDU is carried by L1 in x consecutive radio frames due to radio frame segmentation. In this case, the CFN of the first radio frame in the TTI shall be used as the CFN component of COUNT-C for ciphering of all data in the TTI [15].
8.5.9	START value calculation
In connected mode, if a security mode command procedure has been successfully completed for a CN domain during the current RRC connection, the START value for that CN domain is calculated as:
Let STARTX = the START value for CN domain 'X' prior to the calculation below:
	STARTX' = MSB20 ( MAX {COUNT-C, COUNT-I | radio bearers and signalling radio bearers using the most recently configured CKX and IKX}) + 2.
-	if STARTX'= the maximum value = 1048575 then STARTX = STARTX';
-	if the current STARTX < STARTX' then STARTX = STARTX', otherwise STARTX is unchanged.
NOTE:	Here, "most recently configured" means that if there is more than one key in use for a CN domain, due to non-expiry of the ciphering and/or integrity protection activation time for any signalling radio bearers and/or radio bearers, do not include the COUNT-I/COUNT-C for these signalling radio bearers and/or radio bearers in the calculation of the START X'.
COUNT-C corresponding to non-ciphered radio bearers (i.e. RBs with ciphering status set to "not started") shall not be included in the calculation of the STARTX'. If a radio bearer is released and the radio bearer was ciphered, the values of the COUNT-C at the time the radio bearer is released shall be taken into account in the calculation of the STARTX'.
If a security mode command procedure has not been successfully completed for a CN domain during the current RRC connection, the UE shall use the latest transmitted START value for this CN domain.
8.5.10	Integrity protection
If the "Status" in the variable INTEGRITY_ PROTECTION_INFO has the value "Started" then the UE shall:
1>	perform integrity protection (and integrity checking) on all RRC messages, with the following exceptions:
HANDOVER TO UTRAN COMPLETE
Paging Type 1
PUSCH CAPACITY REQUEST
PHYSICAL SHARED CHANNEL ALLOCATION
RRC Connection Request
RRC Connection Setup
RRC Connection Setup Complete
RRC Connection Reject
RRC CONNECTION RELEASE (CCCH only)
SYSTEM INFORMATION
SYSTEM INFORMATION CHANGE INDICATION
TRANSPORT FORMAT COMBINATION CONTROL (TM DCCH only)
If the "Status" in the variable INTEGRITY_ PROTECTION_INFO has the value "Not started" then integrity protection (and integrity checking) shall not be performed on any RRC message.
For each signalling radio bearer, the UE shall use two RRC hyper frame numbers:
-	"Uplink RRC HFN";
-	"Downlink RRC HFN".
and two message sequence numbers:
-	"Uplink RRC Message sequence number";
-	"Downlink RRC Message sequence number".
The above information is stored in the variable INTEGRITY_PROTECTION_INFO per signalling radio bearer (RB0- RB4).
Upon the first activation of integrity protection for an RRC connection, UE and UTRAN initialise the "Uplink RRC Message sequence number" and "Downlink RRC Message sequence number" for all signalling radio bearers as specified in subclauses 8.6.3.5 and 8.5.10.1.
The RRC message sequence number (RRC SN) is incremented for every integrity protected RRC message.
If the IE "Integrity Protection Mode Info" is present in a received message, the UE shall:
1>	perform the actions in subclause 8.6.3.5 before proceeding with the integrity check of the received message.
8.5.10.1	Integrity protection in downlink
If the UE receives an RRC message on signalling radio bearer with RB identity n, the "Status" in the variable INTEGRITY_ PROTECTION_INFO has the value "Started" and the IE 'Integrity check info' is present the UE shall:
1>	check the value of the IE "RRC message sequence number" included in the IE "Integrity check info";
2>	if the "Downlink RRC Message sequence number" is not present in the variable INTEGRITY_PROTECTION_INFO:
3>	initialise the "Downlink RRC Message sequence number" for signalling radio bearer RBn in the variable INTEGRITY_PROTECTION_INFO with the value of the IE "RRC message sequence number" included in the IE "Integrity check info" of the received message.
2>	if the "Downlink RRC Message sequence number" is present in the variable INTEGRITY_PROTECTION_INFO:
3>	if the RRC message sequence number is lower than the "Downlink RRC Message sequence number" for signalling radio bearer RBn in the variable INTEGRITY_PROTECTION_INFO:
4>	increment "Downlink RRC HFN" for signalling radio bearer RBn in the variable INTEGRITY_PROTECTION_INFO with one.
NOTE:	The actions above imply that also for the case the "Downlink RRC HFN" is re-initialised by a security mode control procedure, this "Downlink RRC HFN" value is incremented by one before it is applied for the integrity protection of any received message if the conditions above are fulfilled.
3>	if the RRC message sequence number is equal to the "Downlink RRC Message sequence number" for signalling radio bearer RBn in the variable INTEGRITY_PROTECTION_INFO:
4>	discard the message.
1>	calculate an expected message authentication code in accordance with subclause 8.5.10.3;
1>	compare the expected message authentication code with the value of the received IE "message authentication code" contained in the IE "Integrity check info";
2>	if the expected message authentication code and the received message authentication code are the same, the integrity check is successful:
3>	update the "Downlink RRC Message sequence number" for signalling radio bearer RBn in the variable INTEGRITY_PROTECTION_INFO with the value of the IE "RRC message sequence number" included in the IE "Integrity check info" of the received RRC message.
2>	if the calculated expected message authentication code and the received message authentication code differ:
3>	act as if the message was not received.
If the UE receives an RRC message on signalling radio bearer with identity 0, 1, or 2, the "Status" in the variable INTEGRITY_ PROTECTION_INFO has the value "Started" and the IE 'Integrity check info' is not present the UE shall:
1>	discard the message.
If the UE receives an RRC message on signalling radio bearer with identity 3 or 4, the "Status" in the variable INTEGRITY_PROTECTION_INFO has the value "Started" and the IE 'Integrity check info' is not present:
1>	if a security mode command procedure has not been successfully completed during the current RRC connection for the CN domain indicated by IE "CN Domain Identity" in the received message:
2>	the UE shall forward the message to upper layer.
1>	else:
2>	the UE shall discard the message.
UTRAN may transmit several copies of the same message in the downlink to increase the probability of proper reception of the message by the UE. In such a case, the RRC SN for these repeated messages should be the same.
8.5.10.2	Integrity protection in uplink
Prior to sending an RRC message using the signalling radio bearer with radio bearer identity n, and the "Status" in the variable INTEGRITY_ PROTECTION_INFO has the value "Started" the UE shall:
1>	increment "Uplink RRC Message sequence number" for signalling radio bearer RBn in the variable INTEGRITY_PROTECTION_INFO with 1, even if the message is a retransmission of a previously transmitted message.
1>	if the "Uplink RRC Message sequence number" for signalling radio bearer RBn in the variable INTEGRITY_PROTECTION_INFO equals zero:
2>	increment "Uplink RRC HFN" for signalling radio bearer RBn in the variable INTEGRITY_PROTECTION_INFO by one.
NOTE 1:	The actions above imply that also for the case the "Uplink RRC HFN" is re-initialised by a security mode control procedure, this "Uplink RRC HFN" is incremented before it is applied in the integrity protection of any transmitted message if the conditions above are fulfilled.
NOTE 2:	For SRB0, this is also valid in case the Message Sequence Number has been increased by N302 +2 resulting in an MSN which equals 0 (i.e.: SRB0 UL activation time equals 0). Then the uplink RRC HFN is incremented by 1 after it is re-initialized and before it is applied in the integrity protection of any transmitted message.
1>	calculate the message authentication code in accordance with subclause 8.5.10.3;
1>	replace the "Message authentication code" in the IE "Integrity check info" in the message with the calculated message authentication code;
1>	replace the "RRC Message sequence number" in the IE "Integrity check info" in the message with contents set to the new value of the "Uplink RRC Message sequence number" for signalling radio bearer RBn in the variable INTEGRITY_PROTECTION_INFO.
In the response message for the procedure ordering the security reconfiguration, the UE indicates the activation time, for each signalling radio bearer. When the new integrity configuration is to be applied in uplink, UTRAN should start to apply the new integrity protection configuration according to the activation time for each signalling radio bearer (except for the signalling radio bearer which is used to send the message that is reconfiguring the security configuration where the new configuration is to be applied starting from and including reception of the response message).
8.5.10.3	Calculation of message authentication code
The UE shall calculate the message authentication code in accordance with [40]. The input parameter MESSAGE [40] for the integrity algorithm shall be constructed by:
1>	setting the "Message authentication code" in the IE "Integrity check info" in the message to the value of the IE "RB identity" for the signalling radio bearer;
1>	setting the "RRC Message sequence number" in the IE "Integrity check info" in the message to zero;
1>	encoding the message;
1>	appending RRC padding (if any) as a bit string to the encoded bit string as the least significant bits.
For usage on an RRC message transmitted or received on the radio bearer with identity n, the UE shall:
1>	construct the input parameter COUNT-I [40] by appending the following IEs from the IE "Signalling radio bearer specific integrity protection information" for radio bearer n in the variable INTEGRITY_PROTECTION_INFO:
2>	for uplink:
3>	"Uplink RRC HFN", as the MSB, and "Uplink RRC Message sequence number", as LSB.
2>	for downlink:
3>	"Downlink RRC HFN", as the MSB, and the IE "RRC message sequence number" included in the IE "Integrity check info", as LSB.
8.5.11	FACH measurement occasion calculation
When in CELL_FACH state and when the variable C_RNTI is non-empty the UE in FDD mode shall perform measurements as specified in subclauses 8.4.1.6 and 8.4.1.9 during the frame(s) with the SFN value fulfilling the following equation:
	SFN div N = C_RNTI mod M_REP + n * M_REP
where
-	N is the TTI (in number of 10ms frames) of the FACH having the largest TTI on the SCCPCH selected by the UE according to the procedure in subclause 8.5.19.  FACHs that only carry MBMS logical channels (MTCH, MSCH, or MCCH) are excluded from measurement occasion calculations.
-	C_RNTI is the C-RNTI value of the UE stored in the variable C_RNTI
-	M_REP is the Measurement Occasion cycle length. According to the equation above, a FACH Measurement Occasion of N frames will be repeated every N * M_REP frame, and M_REP = 2k.
where,
-	k is the FACH Measurement occasion cycle length coefficient.
The value of the FACH Measurement occasion cycle length coefficient is read in system information in "System Information Block type 11" or "System Information Block type 12" in the IE "FACH measurement occasion info".
-	n = 0,1,2… as long as SFN is below its maximum value
The UE is allowed to measure on other occasions in case the UE moves "out of service" area or in case it can simultaneously perform the ordered measurements.
A UE in TDD mode shall use the frame(s) with the SFN value fulfilling the above equation for neighbour cells measurements.
NOTE:	For FDD, in order to meet the MBMS demodulation performance requirements [21], a UE receiving MBMS PTM may not be able use the entire measurement occasion. 
8.5.12	Establishment of Access Service Classes
The PRACH resources (i.e. access slots and preamble signatures for FDD), timeslot (with specific frame allocation and channelisation code for 3.84 Mcps TDD and 7.68 Mcps TDD, and SYNC_UL codes (with specific frame allocation) for 1.28 Mcps TDD) may be divided between different Access Service Classes in order to provide different priorities of RACH usage. It is possible for more than one ASC or for all ASCs to be assigned to the same access slot/signature space in FDD or frame allocation/channelisation codes in 3.84 Mcps TDD or 7.68 Mcps TDD, or frame allocation/SYNC_UL codes in 1.28 Mcps TDD.
Access Service Classes shall be numbered in the range 0  i  NumASC  7 (i.e. the maximum number of ASCs is 8). An ASC is defined by an identifier, i, that defines a certain partition of the PRACH resources (SYNC_UL resources in 1.28 Mcps TDD) and an associated persistence value Pi. A set of ASC parameters consists of "NumASC+1" such parameters (i, Pi), i = 0, …, NumASC.
PRACH partitions shall be established using the information element "PRACH partitioning". The persistence values Pi to be associated with each ASC shall be derived from the dynamic persistence level N = 1,…, 8 which is broadcast in System Information Block 7, and the persistence scaling factors si, broadcast in System Information Block Type 5 or System Information Block type 5bis and possibly also in System Information Block Type 6, as follows:
P(N) = 2(N  1)
ASC # i
0
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
Pi
1
P(N)
s2 P(N)
s3 P(N)
s4 P(N)
s5 P(N)
s6P(N)
s7 P(N)

In addition, MBMS specific persistence values may be provided within the MBMS MODIFIED SERVICES INFORMATION message. The UE behaviour upon receiving upon receiving an MBMS dynamic persistence value is specified in subclause 8.6.9.1a.
Scaling factors si are provided optionally for i = 2,…, NumASC, where NumASC+1 is the number of ASCs as defined by PRACH partitioning. If no scaling factors are broadcast, default value 1 shall be used if NumASC  2.
If k  1 scaling factors are broadcast and NumASC  k+2 then the last scaling factor sk+1 shall be used as default for the ASCs where i > k +1.
The set of ASC parameters is provided to MAC with the CMAC-Config-REQ primitive (see [15]), the PRACH partitioning is provided to PHY using the CPHY-RL-Setup-REQ primitive (see [34]).
The ASC enumeration shall be such that it corresponds to the order of priority (ASC 0 = highest priority, ASC 7 = lowest priority). ASC 0 shall be used in case of Emergency Call or for reasons with equivalent priority.
ASCs are numbered according to the order in which the IEs "ASC Setting" appear in the IE "PRACH partitioning", where the first IE "ASC Setting" describes ASC 0, the second IE "ASC Setting" describes ASC 1, etc.
At radio bearer setup/reconfiguration each involved logical channel is assigned a MAC Logical channel Priority (MLP) in the range 1,…,8. When the MAC sublayer is configured for RACH transmission in the UE, these MLP levels shall be employed for ASC selection on MAC.
8.5.13	Mapping of Access Classes to Access Service Classes
Access Classes shall only be applied at initial access, i.e. when sending an RRC CONNECTION REQUEST message. A mapping between Access Class (AC) and Access Service Class (ASC) shall be indicated by the information element "AC-to-ASC mapping" in System Information Block type 5 or System Information Block type 5bis. The correspondence between AC and ASC shall be indicated as follows.
AC
0 - 9
10
11
12
13
14
15
ASC
1st IE
2nd IE
3rd IE
4th IE
5th IE
6th IE
7th IE

In the table, "nth IE" designates an ASC number i in the range 0 - 7 to AC. If the ASC indicated by the "nth IE" is undefined, the UE behaviour is unspecified.
For the random access, the parameters implied by the respective ASC shall be employed. In case the UE is member of several ACs it shall select the ASC for the highest AC number. In connected mode, AC shall not be applied.
8.5.14	PLMN Type Selection
Depending on UE configuration, the UE is operating in "ANSI-41 mode" or "GSM-MAP mode".
8.5.14a	Neighbour cells list narrowing for cell reselection
While a UE is camping on a suitable cell, a UE having performed the PLMN identification of the neighbour cells as specified in subclause 8.1.1.6.18 shall narrow the cell list to be used for cell reselection ([4]) to those neighbour cells for which:
The PLMN identity is part of the PLMNs that can make a cell suitable as defined in [4].
8.5.15	CFN calculation
The DOFF used in the formulas in this clause concerns the value of IE "Default DPCH Offset Value" received in the message that instructs the UE to enter CELL_DCH state or to perform timing re-initialised hard handover.
Subclause 8.5.15.5 is used in FDD to initialise the CFN for MTCH and/or MSCH if the IE "MBMS Soft Combining Timing Offset" is included for an S-CCPCH in MBMS CURRENT CELL P-T-M RB INFORMATION or MBMS NEIGHBOURING CELL P-T-M RB INFORMATION, and if only MTCH and/or MSCH are on the S-CCPCH. Otherwise, subclauses 8.5.15.1 through 8.5.15.4 are used to intialise the CFN.
8.5.15.1	Initialisation for CELL_DCH state after state transition
When the UE receives any of the messages causing the UE to perform a state transition to CELL_DCH, the UE shall set the CFN in relation to the SFN of the first radio link listed in the IE "Downlink information per radio link list" included in that message according to the following formula:
-	for FDD:
	CFN = (SFN - (DOFF div 38400)) mod 256
	where the formula gives the CFN of the downlink DPCH or F-DPCH frame which starts at the same time as or which starts during the PCCPCH frame with the given SFN. DOFF is determined according to subclause 8.6.6.14.
-	for TDD:
	CFN = (SFN - DOFF) mod 256.
8.5.15.2	Initialisation in CELL_DCH state at hard handover
When the UE is in CELL_DCH state and receives any of the messages causing the UE to perform a hard handover, the UE shall check the IE "Timing indication" in that message and:
1>	if IE "Timing indication" has the value "initialise" (i.e. timing re-initialised hard handover):
2>	read SFN on target cell identified by the first radio link listed in the IE "Downlink information per radio link list" included in that message;
2>	set the CFN according to the following formula:
3>	for FDD:
	CFN = (SFN - (DOFF div 38400)) mod 256
	where the formula gives the CFN of the downlink DPCH or F-DPCH frame which starts at the same time as or which starts during the PCCPCH frame with the given SFN.
3>	for TDD:
	CFN = (SFN - DOFF) mod 256.
1>	if IE "Timing indication" has the value "maintain" (i.e. timing-maintained hard handover), the UE shall keep CFN with no change due to the hard handover, and only increase CFN (mod 256) by 1 every frame.
8.5.15.3	Initialisation for CELL_FACH
Unless the conditions of subclause 8.15.5.5 are met, when the UE performs cell selection, re-selection or changes to CELL_FACH state the UE shall set CFN for all common or shared channels according to:
	CFN = SFN mod 256
	where the formula gives the CFN of the downlink common or shared channel frame which starts at the same time as or which starts during the PCCPCH frame with the given SFN.
After the initialisation, the CFN in the UE is increased (mod 256) by 1 every frame.
8.5.15.4	Initialisation after intersystem handover to UTRAN
Upon inter RAT handover to UTRAN the UE shall, regardless of the value received within IE "Timing indication" (if received):
1>	read SFN on target cell and set the CFN according to the following formula:
2>	for FDD:
	CFN = (SFN - (DOFF div 38400)) mod 256
	where the formula gives the CFN of the downlink DPCH frame which starts at the same time as or which starts during the PCCPCH frame with the given SFN.
2>	for TDD:
	CFN = (SFN - DOFF) mod 256.
8.5.15.5	Initialisation for MTCH and/or MSCH carried on S-CCPCH that may be soft combined
For FDD, if the IE "MBMS Soft Combining Timing Offset" is included for an S-CCPCH in MBMS CURRENT CELL P-T-M RB INFORMATION or MBMS NEIGHBOURING CELL P-T-M RB INFORMATION, and if only MTCH and/or MSCH are on the S-CCPCH, the UE shall set CFN for the S-CCPCH according to:
	CFN = (SFN  (SCTO div 10ms)) mod 256
	where the formula gives the CFN of the downlink S-CCPCH frame which starts at the same time as or which starts during the PCCPCH frame with the given SFN.
	the SCTO used in the formula is the IE "MBMS Soft Combining Timing Offset".
After the initialisation, the CFN in the UE is increased (mod 256) by 1 every frame.
8.5.16	Configuration of CTCH occasions
The CTCH, carrying CBS data is mapped onto only one S-CCPCH. If more than one CTCH is defined, the first CTCH that is configured in the list of S-CCPCHs is the one that is used for CBS data. If the UE is in connected mode it shall ignore any CTCH configuration contained in System Information Block type 6 and use the CTCH configuration contained in System Information Block 5.
The CTCH occasions are identified by the first radio frame of the TTI that can contain CTCH data. The CTCH occasions are fixed on the system frame number cycle 0 .. 4095 (i.e. no modulo calculation) and thus repeated cyclically.
The CTCH occasions are determined by a set of parameters.
MTTI:	number of radio frames within the TTI of the FACH used for CTCH
N:	period of CTCH allocation on S-CCPCH, integer number of radio frames, 
MTTI £ N £ 256, where N is a multiple of MTTI (see [27] and [31]).
MaxSFN:	maximum system frame number = 4095 (see [10]).
K:	CBS frame offset, integer number of radio frames 0 £ K £ N-1 where K is a multiple of MTTI .
The CTCH occasions are calculated as follows:
	SFN = (K + m N), m = 0, 1,..., M, with M chosen that K+MN £ MaxSFN.
The parameters N and K are broadcast as system information.
If the IE "Period of BMC scheduling messages (P)" is included in System Information Block type 5 or System Information Block type 5bis then BMC Schedule Messages are transmitted periodically every P CTCH occasions. One BMC Schedule Message may be segmented across more than one CTCH occasion. The CTCH occasions that contain the start of the BMC Schedule Messages are calculated as follows:
SFN = (K + m P N), where m is an integer and 0 £ SFN £ MaxSFN
If the IE "Period of BMC scheduling messages (P)" is not included in system information block type 5 then BMC Schedule Messages could be transmitted in any CTCH occasion.
8.5.17	PRACH selection
For this version of the specification, when a UE selects a cell, the uplink frequency to be used for the initial PRACH transmission shall have a default duplex frequency spacing offset from the downlink frequency that the cell was selected on. The default duplex frequency separation to be used by the UE is specified in [21] for each frequency band (for FDD only).
NOTE:	The PRACH selection scheme assumes that all PRACHs configured in System Information Block type 5, System Information Block type 5bis and System Information Block type 6 support all (implicitly or explicitly) configurable RLC sizes of the cell, i.e. at least the transport formats corresponding to a single transport block of each applicable RLC size of the cell must be defined for each PRACH.
The UE shall select a "PRACH system information" according to the following rule. The UE shall:
1>	select a "PRACH system information" from the ones indicated in the IE "PRACH system information list" in System Information Block type 5 or in System Information Block type 5bis (applicable in Idle Mode and Connected Mode) or System Information Block type 6 (applicable in Connected Mode only), as follows:
2>	if in connected mode and System Information Block type 6 is defined and includes PRACH info:
3>	compile a list of candidate PRACHs that consists of the PRACH system information listed in System Information Block 6, in the order of appearance as in System Information Block 6.
2>otherwise:
3>	compile a list of candidate PRACHs that consists of the PRACH system information listed in System Information Block 5 or in System Information Block 5bis, in the order of appearance as in System Information Block 5 or in System Information Block 5bis, respectively.
2>	in FDD:
3>	perform RACH TTI selection as specified in subclause 8.5.18.1.
2>	in 1.28 Mcps TDD:
3>	perform RACH TTI selection according to subclause 8.5.18.2.
2>	remove from the list of candidate PRACHs those PRACHs that have a TTI length different from the selected value;
2>	select a PRACH randomly from the list of candidate PRACHs as follows:
	"Index of selected PRACH" = floor (rand * K)
	where K is equal to the number of candidate PRACH system informations, "rand" is a random number uniformly distributed in the range 0  rand < 1 and "floor" refers to rounding down to nearest integer. The candidate PRACH system informations shall be indexed from 0 to K-1. The random number generator is left to implementation. The scheme shall be implemented such that one of the available PRACH system informations is randomly selected with uniform probability. At start-up of the random number generator in the UE the seed shall be dependent on the IMSI of the UE or time, thereby avoiding that all UEs select the same RACH;
2>	use the TFCS of the selected PRACH when performing TFC selection (see [15]);
2>	reselect the PRACH system information when a new cell is selected. RACH reselection may also be performed after each transmission of a Transport Block Set on RACH.
1>	for emergency call, the UE is allowed to select any of the available PRACH system informations.
After selecting a PRACH system information, the RRC in the UE shall configure the MAC and the physical layer for the RACH access according to the parameters included in the selected "PRACH system information" IE.
8.5.18	Selection of RACH TTI
8.5.18.1	FDD
In FDD mode, a RACH may employ either 10 or 20 ms TTI. The supported TTI is indicated as a semi-static parameter of the RACH Transport Format in system information. The UE shall select an appropriate TTI length from the RACHs included in the list of candidate PRACH(s) according to the following rule.
The UE shall:
1>	if only RACHs with one particular TTI length are included in the list of candidate PRACH(s):
2>	select this TTI length and proceed as specified in subclause 8.5.17.
1>	if both PRACHs with 10ms and 20ms TTI lengths are included in the list of candidate PRACH(s):
2>	perform TTI selection as follows:
3>	when the UE calculates the initial preamble transmit power ("Preamble_Initial_Power") as specified in subclause 8.5.7:
4>	select a TF to be employed for calculation of a transmit power margin as follows:
5>	from the TFs supported by all candidate PRACHs keep those which correspond to a single transport block of all configured RLC sizes (i.e., in idle mode, the RLC size applicable for RB0, in connected mode, the RLC sizes configured with explicit "RB mapping info"). If more than a single TF remain applicable, the UE may select any of these. Preferably the UE should select the TF which is intended to be used at the next transmission or, if such information is not available, the TF corresponding to the largest configured RLC size.
4>	calculate a transmit power margin,
	Margin = {min(Maximum allowed UL tx power, P_MAX) -	max(Preamble_Initial_Power, 
	Preamble_Initial_Power + DPp-m + 10*log10(1 + (bd /bc)2)}
	where "Maximum allowed UL tx power" is the maximum allowed uplink transmit power indicated in system information (in dBm), and P_MAX is the maximum RF output power of the UE (dBm). The margin shall be calculated for the gain factors bd and bc of the TF selected in the step above, using 10ms TTI length.
NOTE 1:	the expression Preamble_Initial_Power + DPp-m + 10*log10(1 + (bd /bc)2) represents the total RACH message power if the message would be sent after the initial preamble.
NOTE 2:	For all PRACHs with the same TTI the UTRAN should set each of the IEs "Primary CPICH TX power", "Constant value" to the same value, and within these PRACH configurations, the UTRAN should, for all TFs including a single TB, set each of the IEs "Gain Factor c ", "Gain Factor d" and "Power offset P p-m" to the same value. If these guidelines are not followed, the UE behaviour is unspecified.
3>	if the resulting "Margin" value is less than 6 dB:
4>	select RACH with 20 ms TTI, and proceed as specified in subclause 8.5.17.
3>	otherwise, if the last L1 message transmission on PRACH failed (see [15]):
4>	the UE may select RACH with 20ms TTI length and proceed as specified in subclause 8.5.17.
3>	otherwise:
4>	select RACH with 10ms TTI length and proceed as specified in subclause 8.5.17.
8.5.18.2	1.28 Mcps TDD
In 1.28 Mcps TDD, a RACH may be assigned a 5, 10 or 20 ms TTI. If, in one cell, more than one RACH is defined a UE shall select the RACH that is to be used for each transmission according to the following rule:
1>	if only RACHs with one particular TTI length are assigned a transport format that is suitable for the transmission of the transport block set:
2>	select this RACH's TTI length.
1>	if more than one RACHs are assigned a transport format that is suitable for the transmission of the transport block set:
2>	select the longest of the TTI lengths of these RACHs.
8.5.19	Secondary CCPCH selection
In UTRAN Connected mode, the UE shall select the Secondary CCPCH according to the following rules:
1>	in Cell_DCH state:
2>	select Secondary CCPCH according to subclause 8.6.6.4.
1>	in Cell_FACH state:
2>	if System Information Block type 6 is defined and includes one or more SCCPCH that carry a FACH, compile a list of candidate SCCPCH that consists of these SCCPCH, in the order of appearance in System Information Block type 6.
NOTE 1:	An SCCPCH carries a FACH if the size of the "FACH/PCH information" list within the IE "Secondary CCPCH system information" exceeds 1 or if the size of this list equals 1 while IE "Secondary CCPCH system information" does not contain an IE "PICH info".
2>	otherwise:
3>	compile a list of candidate SCCPCH that consists of the SCCPCH(s) included in System Information Block type 5 or System Information Block type 5bis that carry a FACH, in the order of appearance in System Information Block type 5 or System Information Block type 5bis.
2>	select an SCCPCH from the list of candidate SCCPCHs based on U-RNTI as follows:
	"Index of selected SCCPCH" = U-RNTI mod K,
	where K is equal to the number of candidate SCCPCHs.
1>	in Cell_PCH and URA_PCH states:
2> if System Information Block type 6 is defined and includes one or more SCCPCH that carry a PCH, compile a list of candidate SCCPCH that consists of these SCCPCH, in the order of appearance in System Information Block type 6
NOTE 2:	An SCCPCH carries a PCH if the IE "Secondary CCPCH system information" contains IE "PICH info"
2>	otherwise compile a list of candidate SCCPCH that consists of the SCCPCH(s) included in System Information Block type 5 or System Information Block type 5bis that that carry a PCH , in the order of appearance in System Information Block type 5 or System Information Block type 5bis;
2>	select an SCCPCH from the list of candidate SCCPCHs based on U-RNTI as follows:
	"Index of selected SCCPCH" = U-RNTI mod K,
	where K is equal to the number of candidate SCCPCHs.
The UE shall set the CFN in relation to the SFN of the current cell according to subclause 8.5.15.
The UE shall decode all transport formats on all FACHs multiplexed on the selected S-CCPCH according to its UE capability, as defined in subclauses 8.1.1.6.5 and 8.1.1.6.6, to find blocks adressed to the UE.
8.5.19a	Secondary CCPCH and FACH selection for MCCH reception
The UE shall select the Secondary CCPCH for acquiring MCCH information according to the following rules:
1>	if System Information Block type 5 or System Information Block type 5bis  is defined and includes an S-CCPCH within the IE "Secondary CCPCH system information" including a FACH for which the IE "MCCH configuration information" is included:
2>	select that S-CCPCH and FACH for receiving MCCH.
1>	otherwise if System Information Block type 5 or System Information Block type 5bis is defined and includes an SCCPCH within the IE "Secondary CCPCH system information MBMS" for which the IE "FACH carrying MCCH" is included:
2>	select that S-CCPCH and FACH for receiving MCCH.
8.5.20	Unsupported configuration
The UE should set the variable UNSUPPORTED_CONFIGURATION to TRUE if the received message is not according to the UE capabilities.
8.5.21	Actions related to Radio Bearer mapping 
When the UE receives the IE "RB mapping info" and/or the IE "Transport format set", when transport channels, MAC-d flows or E-DCH MAC-d flows are added or deleted, when the UE performs a cell reselection or a state transition, or when the UE releases a RB, the UE shall for each of the configured Radio Bearers:

4>	select this multiplexing option.
1>	configure the MAC with the appropriate transport format set (with computed transport block sizes) for the transport channel used by that RB;
1>	in case the selected multiplexing option is a multiplexing option on E-DCH:
2>	the set of RLC sizes that apply to the logical channel used by that RB consists of all RLC PDU sizes listed in the IE "RLC PDU size list" in the RB mapping info for E-DCH.
1>	else:
2>	determine the sets of RLC sizes that apply to the logical channels used by that RB, based on the IEs "RLC size list" and/or the IEs "Logical Channel List" included in the applicable "Transport format set" (either the ones received in the same message or the ones stored if none were received);
1>	in case the selected multiplexing option is a multiplexing option on RACH:
2>	ignore the RLC size indexes that do not correspond to any RLC size within the Transport Format Set stored for RACH.
2>	if there is no remaining RLC size index corresponding to an RLC size within the Transport Format Set stored for RACH:
3>	set the variable INVALID_CONFIGURATION to TRUE.
1>	if RACH is the transport channel to be used on the uplink, if that RB has a multiplexing option on RACH and if it is using AM:
2>	apply the largest size amongst the ones derived according to the previous bullet for the RLC size (or RLC sizes in case the RB is realised using two logical channels) for the corresponding RLC entity.
NOTE:	The IE "RB mapping info" is only included in the IE "Predefined RB configurations" in system information when used for Inter-RAT handover to UTRAN and there is no AM RLC size change involved in this case.
1>	if that RB is using AM and the RLC size applicable to the uplink logical channel transporting data PDUs is different from the one derived from the previously stored configuration; and
1>	none of the following conditions is met:
-	the RLC size change is caused by a CELL UPDATE CONFIRM and the CELL UPDATE CONFIRM message includes the IE "Downlink counter synchronisation info".
-	the RLC size change is caused by a reconfiguration message, and a cell update procedure occurs during the reconfiguration procedure and the CELL UPDATE CONFIRM message includes the IE "Downlink counter synchronisation info".
-	the RLC size change is caused by a reconfiguration message, and a cell update procedure occurs during this reconfiguration procedure and the CELL UPDATE CONFIRM message includes the IE "RLC re-establish indicator" being set to TRUE for the corresponding radio bearer.
2>	if the RLC size change is caused by a reconfiguration message or a CELL UPDATE CONFIRM; and
2>	the IE "one sided RLC re-establishment" is included in that message and is set to TRUE:
3>	re-establish the transmitting side of the corresponding RLC entity.
2>	else:
3>	re-establish the corresponding RLC entity.
2>	configure the corresponding RLC entity with the new uplink RLC size;
2>	for each AM RLC radio bearer in the CN domain as indicated in the IE "CN domain identity" in the IE "RAB info" in the variable ESTABLISHED_RABS whose RLC size is changed; and
2>	for each AM RLC signalling radio bearer in the CN domain as indicated in the IE "CN domain identity" in the variable LATEST_CONFIGURED_CN_DOMAIN whose RLC size is changed:
3>	if the IE "Status" in the variable CIPHERING_STATUS of this CN domain is set to "Started":
4>	if the information causing the RLC re-establishment was included in system information:
5>	set the HFN values for the corresponding RLC entity equal to the value of the IE "START" for this CN domain that will be included in the CELL UPDATE message following cell reselection.
NOTE:	Since the UE cannot predict the START value at the time of the next CELL UPDATE transmission in the future, UTRAN should desist from changing the RLC size for a signalling radio bearer within a cell. Other than this case the change in RLC size for a signalling radio bearer is known to the UE when reading system information following cell reselection.
4>	if the RLC re-establishment is caused by a CELL UPDATE CONFIRM:
5>	if the whole RLC entity was re-established:
	6>	set the HFN values for the corresponding RLC entity in uplink and downlink equal to the 				value of the IE "START" included in the latest transmitted CELL UPDATE message for this 			CN domain.

5>	if only the transmitting side of the RLC entity was re-established:
	6>	set the HFN value for the corresponding RLC entity in the uplink equal to the value of the 				IE "START" included in the latest transmitted CELL UPDATE message for this CN 						domain.

4>	if the RLC re-establishment is caused by a reconfiguration message:
5>	if the whole RLC entity was re-established:
	6>	set the HFN values for the corresponding RLC entity in uplink and downlink equal to the value 			of the IE "START" that will be included in the reconfiguration complete message for this CN 			domain.

5>	if only the transmitting side of the RLC entity was re-established:
	6>	set the HFN value for the corresponding RLC entity in the direction uplink equal to the value 			of the IE "START" that will be included in the reconfiguration complete message for this CN 			domain.

NOTE1:	If the UTRAN modifies the RLC size for RB2 on any reconfiguration message or Cell Update Confirm message, the UE behaviour is unspecified in this version of the specification.
NOTE2:	The UE cannot rely on the configured Transport Formats to determine the RLC sizes to be used in downlink for a particular logical channel. This size can be signalled explicitly in the RLC Info IE.
1>	if that RB is using UM:
2>	indicate the largest RLC size applicable for uplink to the corresponding RLC entity.
1>	configure MAC multiplexing according to the selected multiplexing option (MAC multiplexing shall only be configured for a logical channel if the transport channel it is mapped on according to the selected multiplexing option is the same as the transport channel another logical channel is mapped on according to the multiplexing option selected for it);
1>	configure the MAC with the logical channel priorities according to selected multiplexing option;
1>	configure the MAC with the set of applicable RLC Sizes for each of the logical channels used for that RB;
1>	if there is no multiplexing option applicable for the transport channels and MAC-d flows to be used:
2>	set the variable INVALID_CONFIGURATION to TRUE.
1>	if there is more than one multiplexing option applicable for the transport channels or MAC-d flows to be used:
2>	set the variable INVALID_CONFIGURATION to TRUE.
If upon cell re-selection or upon moving to CELL_FACH state from CELL_DCH state to initiate cell update procedure the UE sets variable INVALID_CONFIGURATION to TRUE as a result of the actions defined in this subclause, the UE should:
1>	move to idle mode;
1>	release (locally) the established signalling connections (as stored in the variable ESTABLISHED_SIGNALLING_CONNECTIONS) and the established radio access bearers (as stored in the variable ESTABLISHED_RABS) and indicate this to upper layers;
1>	perform other actions when entering idle mode from connected mode as specified in subclause 8.5.2.
8.5.22	Actions when entering another RAT from connected mode
NOTE:	This section does not apply when entering GERAN Iu mode from UTRAN connected mode.
When entering another RAT from connected mode (due to Inter-RAT handover from UTRAN, Inter-RAT cell change order from UTRAN or Inter-RAT cell reselection from UTRAN), after successful completion of the procedure causing the transition to the other RAT, the UE shall:
1>	if the USIM is present, for each CN domain:
2>	if a new security key set was received for this CN domain but was not used either for integrity protection or ciphering during this RRC connection: 
3>	set the START value for this domain to zero and;
3>	store this START value for this domain in the USIM;
2>	else:
3>	store the current START value for every CN domain in the USIM [50].
NOTE:	Prior to storing the START value, the UE should calculate this START value according to subclause 8.5.9.
1>	if the SIM is present, for each CN domain:
2>	if a new security key was received for this CN domain but was not used either for integrity protection or ciphering during this RRC connection: 
3>	set the START value for this domain to zero and;
3>	store this START value for this domain in the UE.
2>	else:
3>	store the current START value for this CN domain in the UE.
NOTE:	Prior to storing the START value, the UE should calculate this START value according to subclause 8.5.9.
8.5.23	Measured results on RACH
When transmitting an uplink RRC message and System Information Block type 11, System Information Block type 11bis and System Information Block type 12, if transmitted, have been received, the UE shall:
1>	if the uplink RRC message is an RRC CONNECTION REQUEST message:
2>	if the IE "Intra-frequency reporting quantity for RACH reporting" and the IE "Maximum number of reported cells on RACH" are included in System Information Block type 11:
3>	include a measurement report in the IE "Measured results on RACH", as specified in the IE "Intra-frequency reporting quantity for RACH reporting" and the IE "Maximum number of reported cells on RACH" in System Information Block type 11.
2>	if the IE "Inter-frequency RACH reporting information" is included in System Information Block type 11:
3>	if, at the time the message is to be sent, valid measurements are available; and
3>	there is one or more cells for which the quantity, indicated by the IE "Reporting quantity" in the IE "Inter-frequency RACH reporting information”, exceeds the threshold specified by the IE "Inter-frequency RACH reporting threshold":
4>	include a measurement report in the IE "Measured results on RACH";
4>	include the cells for which the quantity, indicated by the IE "Reporting quantity" in the IE "Inter-frequency RACH reporting information”, exceeds the threshold specified by the IE "Inter-frequency RACH reporting threshold";
4>	set the IE "Inter-frequency cell indication- SIB11" to the following value: Value_Tag MOD 2, with Value_Tag corresponding to the value tag of System Information Block Type 11;
4>	set the IE "Inter-frequency cell indication- SIB12" to any value.
1>	for any other uplink RRC message which optionally includes the IE "Measured results on RACH":
2>	if the IE "Intra-frequency reporting quantity for RACH reporting" and the IE "Maximum number of reported cells on RACH" are included in System Information Block type 12 (or "System Information Block Type 11", if these IEs are not included in the broadcast "System Information Block Type 12" or "System Information Block Type 12" is not being broadcast).
3>	include a measurement report in the IE "Measured results on RACH", as specified in the IE "Intra-frequency reporting quantity for RACH reporting" and the IE "Maximum number of reported cells on RACH" in System Information Block type 12 (or "System Information Block Type 11" if these IEs are not included in the broadcast "System Information Block Type 12" or "System Information Block Type 12" is not being broadcast).
2>	if the IE "Inter-frequency RACH reporting information" is included in "System Information Block type 12" (or "System Information Block Type 11" if this IE is not included in the "System Information Block Type 12" or if "System Information Block Type 12" is not being broadcast):
3>	if, at the time the message is to be sent, valid measurements are available; and
3>	there is one or more cells for which the quantity, indicated by the IE "Reporting quantity" in the IE "Inter-frequency RACH reporting information”, exceeds the threshold specified by the IE "Inter-frequency RACH reporting threshold":
4>	include a measurement report in the IE "Measured results on RACH";
4>	include the cells for which the quantity, indicated by the IE "Reporting quantity" in the IE "Inter-frequency RACH reporting information", exceeds the threshold specified by the IE "Inter-frequency RACH reporting threshold";
4>	set the IE "Inter-frequency cell indication- SIB11" to the following value: Value_Tag MOD 2, with Value_Tag corresponding to the value tag of System Information Block Type 11;
4>	if "System Information Block Type 12" is being broadcast:
5>	set the IE "Inter-frequency cell indication- SIB12" to the following value: Value_Tag MOD 2, with Value_Tag corresponding to the value tag of System Information Block Type 12.
4>	else:
5>	set the IE "Inter-frequency cell indication- SIB12" to any value.
1>	include in the IE "Measured results on RACH" all requested reporting quantities for cells for which measurements are reported. 
NOTE: 	The UE only includes measurement results for neighbour cells for which valid measurements are available at the time the message is sent. At cell access following selection or reselection to a cell, the UE may not have had sufficient time to obtain valid measurement results for neighbour cells.
1>	for messages transmitted on CCCH, take care that the maximum allowed message size is not exceeded when forming the IE "Measured results on RACH", i.e. limit the number of included neighbour cells or if required omit the IE "Measured results on RACH" altogether. When limiting the number of included neighbouring cells, the number of inter-frequency cells should be limited first i.e. inter-frequency cells should be omitted before limiting  the number of intra- frequency cells.
When transmitting an uplink RRC message and the System Information Block type 11, System Information Block type 11bis and System Information Block type 12, if transmitted, have not been received, the UE shall:
1>	for any uplink RRC message which optionally includes the IE "Measured results on RACH", include a measurement report in the IE "Measured results on RACH" according to the following rules:
2>	if the IE "Intra-frequency reporting quantity" was not present in System Information Block type 3:
3>	include a measurement report for the serving cell using CPICH RSCP as a measurement quantity;
3>	include measurement reports for cells on the used frequency for which measured results are available, using CPICH RSCP as measurement quantity for each cell;
3>	omit the IE "Measurement results for monitored cells on non-used frequencies".
2>	if the IE "Intra-frequency reporting quantity" was present in System Information Block type 3:
3>	include a measurement report for the serving cell using as a measurement quantity given in IE “Intra-frequency reporting quantity”;
3>	include measurement reports for cells on the used frequency for which measured results are available, using as a measurement quantity given in IE "Intra-frequency reporting quantity" for each cell;
3>	omit the IE "Measurement results for monitored cells on non-used frequencies".
2>	for TDD, include measurement reports using the measurement quantities specified in the IE "Reporting quantity list".
If the IE "Measured results on RACH" is present in the message, the UTRAN should extract the contents to be used for radio resource control.
8.5.24	Change of PLMN while in RRC connected mode
If the UE camps on an acceptable cell to obtain limited service while in RRC connected mode the UE shall:
1>	keep the RRC connection and its behaviour, while camping on an acceptable cell as if in Idle mode in that PLMN;
1>	if the UE re-enters "in service area" in a suitable cell, or cannot maintain limited service (i.e. cannot find any acceptable cell of any PLMN), the UE shall resume its RRC Connected mode behaviour as if it had not camped on any cell whilst being in "out of service area".
The UE shall:
1>	if the NAS indicates the selection of a new PLMN resulting from manual- or automatic mode PLMN selection [25] while the UE is in RRC connected mode; or
1>	if the UE attempts transmission on an acceptable cell while the UE is in RRC connected mode (i.e. to initiate emergency call), the UE shall:
2>	move to idle mode;
2>	release all dedicated resources;
2>	indicate release (abort) of the established signalling connections (as stored in the variable ESTABLISHED_SIGNALLING_CONNECTIONS) and established radio access bearers (as stored in the variable ESTABLISHED_RABS) to upper layers;
2>	clear the variable ESTABLISHED_SIGNALLING_CONNECTIONS;
2>	clear the variable ESTABLISHED_RABS; and
2>	perform actions specified in subclause 8.5.2 when entering idle mode from connected mode.
NOTE:	NAS can inform AS about a new selected PLMN as a result of a PLMN selection (manual- or automatic mode PLMN selection (see [25])), or as a result of network signalling (after inter-RAT handover or inter-PLMN SRNS relocation). Only in the first case (manual- or automatic mode PLMN selection), this will result in an immediate RRC connection release.
8.5.25	Actions related to HS_DSCH_RECEPTION variable
The variable HS_DSCH_RECEPTION shall be set to "TRUE" only when all the following conditions are met:
1>	for FDD and 1.28 Mcps TDD:
2>	the UE is in CELL_DCH state.
1>	for 3.84 Mcps TDD or 7.68 Mcps TDD:
2>	a dedicated physical channel is allocated to the UE in the uplink.
1>	the variable H_RNTI is set;
1>	the UE has a stored IE "HS-SCCH info";
1>	the UE has a stored IE "HARQ info";
1>	for FDD:
2>	one of the radio links in the active set is configured as the serving HS-DSCH radio link;
2>	the UE has stored the following IEs:
-	IE "Measurement Feedback Info";
-	IE "Uplink DPCH Power Control Info" including stored ACK,  NACK  and Ack-NACK Repetition factor.
1>	for 3.84 Mcps TDD or 7.68 Mcps TDD, the UE has stored the IE "HS-PDSCH Timeslot Configuration" and either of the following conditions are met:
2>	a dedicated physical channel is allocated to the UE in the downlink;
2>	the UE has stored Dhs-sync.
1>	for 1.28 Mcps TDD, the UE has stored the IE "HS-PDSCH Midamble Configuration" and either of the following conditions are met:
2>	a dedicated physical channel is allocated to the UE in the downlink;
2>	the UE has stored "PLCCH Info".
1>	there is at least one RB mapped to HS-DSCH;
1>	at least for one of the RB’s mapped to HS-DSCH, there is at least one MAC-hs queue (including the IE "MAC-d PDU size Info") configured for the concerning MAC-d flow;
NOTE 1:	To enable or disable HS-DSCH reception, the UTRAN has the possibility to add/remove the concerning HS-DSCH related RB mapping options, add/remove the concerning MAC-d flows or, for FDD, add/remove the serving HS-DSCH radio link or, for TDD add/remove H-RNTI upon hard handover.
NOTE 2:	If HS_DSCH_RECEPTION is set to "TRUE" and a reconfiguration, an inter-RAT handover from UTRAN, or a cell change order procedure is initiated, the UE checks the conditions only when the reconfiguration, inter-RAT handover from UTRAN, or cell change order procedure is successfully completed. Doing so ensures that, in case of failure in the reconfiguration, inter-RAT handover from UTRAN, or cell change order procedure, the UE can return to the old configuration as if the message was not received, e.g. without performing a MAC-HS reset.
If any of the above conditions is not met and the variable HS_DSCH_RECEPTION is set to TRUE, the UE shall:
1>	set the variable HS_DSCH_RECEPTION to FALSE;
1>	stop any HS_SCCH reception procedures;
1>	stop any HS-DSCH reception procedures;
1>	clear the variable H_RNTI and remove any stored H-RNTI;
1>	reset the MAC-hs entity [15];
1>	release all HARQ resources;
1>	no long consider any radio link to be the HS-DSCH serving radio link;
1>	for 3.84 Mcps TDD or 7.68 Mcps TDD, if no downlink DPCH is assigned the UE shall clear the uplink DPCH configuration and initiate the Cell Update procedure according to subclause 8.3.1, cause "radio link failure".
NOTE 3:	If configured for HS-DSCH and not explicitly indicated as being cleared, the UE will have still stored the IEs "HARQ info", "Added or Reconfigured MAC-d flow", "RB mapping Info" and "Downlink HS-PDSCH information".
Whenever the variable HS_DSCH_RECEPTION is set to TRUE, the UE shall:
1>	perform HS_SCCH reception procedures according to the stored HS-SCCH configuration as stated in:
2>	subclause 8.6.6.33 for the IE "HS-SCCH Info".
1>	perform HS-DSCH reception procedures according to the stored HS-PDSCH configuration as stated in:
2>	subclause 8.6.3.1b for the IE "H-RNTI";
2>	subclause 8.6.5.6b for the IE "HARQ info";
2>	subclause 8.6.6.34 for the IE "Measurement Feedback Info".
Whenever the variable HS_DSCH_RECEPTION is set to FALSE, the UE shall:
1>	not perform HS_SCCH reception procedures;
1>	not perform HS-DSCH reception procedures.
8.5.26	Service prioritisation
If the UE detects an MBMS service reception inability as specified in subclause 8.5.30, the UE may:
1>	request upper layers to prioritise the services and to initiate release of non- prioritised services that may cause interruption in the reception of the prioritised services;
1>	if reception of the prioritised MBMS service is inhibited by one or more MBMS service(s) provided via a p-t-p radio bearer:
2>	request UTRAN to terminate these MBMS service(s) using the MBMS MODIFICATION REQUEST message as specified in subclause 8.7.6.
NOTE:	The termination of MBMS services is performed by RRC procedures, while clearing of non- MBMS services is performed by upper layers.
8.5.27	MBMS frequency selection
The UE shall perform the MBMS frequency layer selection procedure upon receiving the IE "MBMS Preferred frequency information", when specified explicitly e.g. as in subclause 8.6.9.2, or when the priority for an MBMS service as indicated by upper layers changes.
The UE shall:
1>	if there exist two or more preferred frequencies for services included in variable MBMS_ACTIVATED_SERVICES:
2>	request from upper layers the priorities of the different MBMS services included in variable MBMS_ACTIVATED_SERVICES for which a preferred frequency has been received.
1>	if the UE is in idle mode:
2>		if a preferred frequency layer applies for a service included in variable MBMS_ACTIVATED_SERVICES:
3>		select the preferred frequency indicated for the MBMS service(s) prioritised most by upper layers for which a preferred frequency exists as the preferred frequency.
1>	if the UE is in CELL_FACH, CELL_PCH or URA_PCH state; and
1>	if there exists one or more preferred frequencies for services included in variable MBMS_ACTIVATED_SERVICES and the variable MBMS_PL_SERVICE_RESTRICTION_INFO_DEDICATED is set to FALSE:
2>	if the IE "RAB information" in the variable ESTABLISHED_RABS is not empty:
3>	if the current frequency is the frequency corresponding with the preferred frequency indicated for the MBMS service(s) prioritised most by upper layers for which a preferred frequency exists:
4>	select the current frequency as the preferred frequency.
3>	else:
4>	if there exists one or more preferred frequencies for services included in variable MBMS_ACTIVATED_SERVICES for which the IE "MBMS PL Service Restriction Information" has not been received in the MBMS GENERAL INFORMATION message:
5>	select the preferred frequency indicated for the MBMS service(s) prioritised most by upper layers for which a preferred frequency exists for which the IE "MBMS PL Service Restriction Information" has not been received in the MBMS GENERAL INFORMATION message as the preferred frequency.

8.6.3.1	Activation time
If the UE receives a message in which presence is needed for the IE "Activation time", and the value is other than the default value "Now", the UE shall:
1>	let the "reference CCTrCH" be defined as the CCTrCh that includes any transport channel or is associated with any physical channel which is being added, re-configured or removed, or, in the case of HS-DSCH, the CCTrCh including the associated DCH;
1>	if the frame boundary immediately before the frame with the CFN (Connection Frame Number) value indicated by the IE "Activation Time" is at the TTI boundary common to all the transport channels that are multiplexed onto the reference CCTrCh:
2>	select that frame boundary as the activation time T.
1>	else:
2>	select the next TTI boundary, which is common to all the transport channels that are multiplexed onto the reference CCTrCh, after the frame with the CFN (Connection Frame Number) value indicated by the IE "Activation Time", as the activation time T.
1>	if the IE "Delay restriction flag" is received and activation time T is more than 128 frames from the CFN at which the message was received:
2>	choose an activation time T as soon as possible after reception of the message, respecting the performance requirements in subclause 13.5, which is common to all the transport channels that are multiplexed onto the reference CCTrCh.
NOTE:	If the UE receives a message containing the IE "Delay restriction flag" and that message causes a transport channel or physical channel reconfiguration of the reference CCTrCH then the UE behaviour is not specified.

NOTE:	In FDD an "HS-DSCH related reconfiguration" includes, in particular, reconfigurations that need to be time-aligned with the 2ms subframe of the HS-SCCH, HS-PDSCH and/or HS-DPCCH. For example, start and stop of HS-SCCH reception and serving HS-DSCH cell change.
If the UE receives a message in which presence is needed for the IE "Activation time", and the value is the default value "Now", the UE shall:

NOTE:	In FDD, if the UE was in idle mode or CELL_FACH state upon reception of the message, regardless of the state the UE enters after reception of the message, and the value of the IE "Activation time" in the received message is different from "Now", the UE behaviour is unspecified. In TDD, if the UE was in idle mode or CELL_FACH state upon reception of the message, the value of the IE "Activation time" in the received message is relative to the CFN associated with the cell from which the message was received.
8.6.3.1a	CN domain specific DRX cycle length coefficient
The UE updates CN domain specific DRX cycle length coefficient as specified in [4]. The UE shall use it to calculate the CN domain specific DRX cycle length, according to the following:
1>	set k to the value of the IE "CN domain specific DRX cycle length coefficient".
1>	store the result of MAX(2k, PBP), where PBP is the Paging Block Periodicity, as the CN domain specific DRX cycle length for the CN domain indicated by the IE "CN domain identity". For FDD PBP=1.
The UE shall determine its idle mode paging occasions and PICH monitoring occasions for that CN domain, according to [4], based on the stored CN domain specific DRX cycle length, when using DRX in idle mode.

If the IE "New H-RNTI" is included and the UE will be in CELL_DCH state after completion of this procedure, the UE shall:
1>	store the value in the variable H_RNTI;
1>	determine the value for the HS_DSCH_RECEPTION variable and take the corresponding actions as described in subclause 8.5.25.
If the message that triggers the HS_DSCH_RECEPTION variable to change value from FALSE to TRUE does not contain the IE "New H-RNTI":
1>	the UE behaviour is not defined.

1>	store the result of MAX(2k,PBP), where PBP is the Paging Block Periodicity, as the DRX cycle length.
The UE shall determine its connected mode paging occasions and PICH monitoring occasions in the same way as for idle mode, according to [4].
The DRX cycle length to use in connected mode is defined in [4].
8.6.3.3	Generic state transition rules depending on received information elements
The IE "RRC State Indicator" indicates the state the UE shall enter. The UE shall enter the state indicated by the IE "RRC State Indicator" even if the received message includes other IEs relevant only for states other than indicated by the IE "RRC State Indicator". E.g. if the RRC state indicator is set to CELL_FACH while other IEs provide information about a configuration including dedicated channels, the UE shall enter CELL_FACH state. If however the UE has no information about the configuration corresponding to the state indicated by the IE "RRC State Indicator", it shall consider the requested configuration as invalid.
The UE shall, if the IE "RRC State Indicator" in the received message has the value:
1>	"CELL_FACH":
2>	enter CELL_FACH state as dictated by the procedure governing the message received.
1>	"CELL_DCH":
2>	if neither DPCH is assigned in the message nor is the UE in CELL_DCH:
3>	set the variable INVALID_CONFIGURATION to TRUE.
2>	else:
3>	enter CELL_DCH state as dictated by the procedure governing the message received.
1>	"CELL_PCH":
2>	if the received message is RRC CONNECTION SETUP and IE "RRC State Indicator" is set to CELL_PCH:
3>	set the variable INVALID_CONFIGURATION to TRUE.
2>	else:
3>	enter CELL_PCH state as dictated by the procedure governing the message received.
1>	"URA_PCH":
2>	if the received message is RRC CONNECTION SETUP and IE "RRC State Indicator" is set to URA_PCH:
3>	set the variable INVALID_CONFIGURATION to TRUE.
2>	else:
3>	enter URA_PCH state as dictated by the procedure governing the message received.
8.6.3.4	Ciphering mode info
The IE "Ciphering mode info" defines the new ciphering configuration. At any given time, the UE needs to store at most two different ciphering configurations (keyset and algorithm) per CN domain at any given time in total for all radio bearers and three configurations in total for all signalling radio bearers.
If the IE "Ciphering mode info" is present and if the IE "Reconfiguration" in the variable CIPHERING_STATUS is set to TRUE, the UE shall:
1>	ignore this second attempt to change the ciphering configuration; and
1>	set the variable INCOMPATIBLE_SECURITY_RECONFIGURATION to TRUE.

8.6.3.11	RRC transaction identifier
The IE "RRC transaction identifier" may be used, together with the message type, for identification of an invocation of a downlink procedure (transaction). The UE behaviour for accepting or rejecting transactions based on the message type and the IE "RRC transaction identifier" is specified below.
If the IE "RRC transaction identifier" is included in a received message, the UE shall perform the actions below. The UE shall:
If the received message is any of the messages:

1>	else:
2>	if the variable ORDERED_RECONFIGURATION is set to TRUE; or
2>	if the variable CELL_UPDATE_STARTED is set to TRUE; or
2>	if the table "Accepted transactions" in the variable TRANSACTIONS contains an entry with an IE "Message Type" set to ACTIVE SET UPDATE; or
2>	if the received message contains a protocol error according to clause 9 causing the variable PROTOCOL_ERROR_REJECT to be set to TRUE:
3>	if the IE "RRC transaction identifier" of the received message is identical to the "RRC transaction identifier" stored for the same "Message Type" as the received message in the table "Accepted transactions" in the variable TRANSACTIONS:
4>	ignore the transaction; and
4>	continue with any ongoing processes and procedures as the message was not received;
4>	and end the procedure.

4>	store the IE "Message type" and the IE "RRC transaction identifier" of the received message in the table "Accepted transactions" in the variable TRANSACTIONS, replacing the previous entry.
NOTE 1:	The UE is expected to process the first RRC CONNECTION SETUP/CELL UPDATE CONFIRM/URA UPDATE COMFIRM message that it receives after transmitting an RRC CONNECTION REQUEST/CELL_UPDATE/URA_UPDATE message. If the UE receives further RRC CONNECTION SETUP/CELL UPDATE CONFIRM/URA UPDATE COMFIRM messages without having transmitted another RRC CONNECTION REQUEST/CELL_UPDATE/URA_UPDATE message, the UE is not required to process these messages.
NOTE 2:	If the previously accepted transaction was a CELL UPDATE CONFIRM/URA UPDATE CONFIRM that included the IE "Dowlink counter synchronisation info", rather than ignore the first accepted transaction the UE may continue with the first transaction in the case where a cell re-selection interrupted the on-going procedure causing a cell update procedure to be triggered. In this case the response message acts as an explicit acknowledgement of both the CELL UPDATE CONFIRM/URA UPDATE CONFIRM message signalling an SRNS relocation and the subsequent CELL UPDATE CONFIRM/URA UPDATE CONFIRM.

	TB size = RLC size + MAC header size	if "RLC size" <> 0,
	TB size = 0		if "RLC size" = 0,

2>		perform the actions as specified in subclause 8.5.21.
For configuration restrictions on Blind Transport Format Detection, see [27].
8.6.5.2	Transport format combination set
If the IE "Transport format combination set" is included for the uplink, the UE shall for that direction:
1>	store the new transport format combination set, or (if this exists) modify a previously stored transport format combination set according to IEs included in IE "Transport format combination set";
1>	start to respect those transport format combinations;
1>	if IE "Transport format combination subset" is received in this message:
2>	perform the actions as specified in subclause 8.6.5.3.

2>	clear the IE "Duration" in the variable TFC_SUBSET;
2>	set both the IE "Current TFC subset" and the IE "Default TFC subset" in the variable TFC_SUBSET to the value indicating "full transport format combination set".
If the IE "Transport format combination set" is included for the downlink, the UE shall for that direction:
1>	store the new transport format combination set, or (if this exists) modify a previously stored transport format combination set according to IEs included in IE "Transport format combination set";
1>	start to respect those transport format combinations.
If the IE "Transport format combination set" is not included for the uplink and if there is no addition, removal or reconfiguration of transport channels, the UE shall for that direction:
1>	use a previously stored transport format combination set if this exists.
If the IE "Transport format combination set" is not included for the downlink and if there is no addition, removal or reconfiguration of transport channels, the UE shall for that direction:
1>	use a previously stored transport format combination set if this exists.
If the IE "Transport format combination set" is not included for either the uplink or the downlink and for that direction after the reconfiguration there is one or more stored DCH configuration; and
1>	if no transport format combination set is stored in the UE; or
1>	if transport channels are added or removed in the message; or
1>	if any transport channel is reconfigured in the message such that the size of the transport format set is changed:
the UE shall:
1>	set the variable INVALID_CONFIGURATION to TRUE.
If the IE "Transport format combination set" is not included for either the uplink or the downlink and for that direction after the reconfiguration there is no stored DCH configuration, the UE shall:
1>	remove any stored transport format combination set for dedicated channels for that direction.
In the uplink TFCS the minimum set of TFCs is the set of TFCs that is needed for the TFC selection algorithm defined in [15] to give a predictable result. Any configured TFCS or TFC subset shall satisfy the requirements as specified by the minimum set. In the definition of the minimum set of TFCs below, only logical channels for which the TFCS or the TFC subset include at least one TFC with non-empty TF for the corresponding transport channel should be considered.
The minimum set of TFCs consists of the following:
1>	for each UM logical channel:
2>	a TFC with one transport block for this transport channel and empty TFs (see [34]) for all the others. If more than one TFC fulfils these criteria, only the TFC with the lowest number of bits should be included in the minimum set of TFCs.
1>	for each AM logical channel:
2>	a TFC with a non-empty TF for the corresponding transport channel and empty TFs for all other transport channels, where the non-empty TF includes one transport block with "Configured RLC Size" equal to the RLC PDU size.
1>	for each set of "synchronous" TM logical channels (see the definition below) and for each set of SDU sizes associated with it:
2>	a TFC with TFs corresponding to any combination of SDU sizes that can be received in a TTI from higher layers on the corresponding transport channels and empty TFs for all other transport channels. 
NOTE:	In case an adaptive rate codec is used and the TFCS has been restricted by the IE "TFC subset", the minimum set consists of the set of TFCs with TFs corresponding to any combination of SDU sizes that can be received in a TTI respecting the restricted TFCS.
1>	for each TM logical channel that is not part of a set of "synchronous" TM logical channels (see the definition below):
2>	a TFC with non-empty TFs for the corresponding transport channel, and empty TFs for all other transport channels, where
3>	for non-segmented mode TM-RLC logical channels the non-empty TFs include, for the smallest SDU size that can be received in a single TTI from higher layer:
4>	a TF with non-zero number of transport blocks with "Configured RLC Size" equal to the corresponding SDU size. If more than one TFC fulfils these criteria, only the TFC with the lowest number of bits in the TFC is included in the minimum set of TFCs.
3>	for segmented mode TM-RLC, the non-empty TFs include any TF such that the number of transport blocks multiplied by the "Configured RLC Size" is equal to the smallest SDU size that can be received in a single TTI from higher layer.
1>	an "empty" TFC (see [34]).
Furthermore, the UTRAN should ensure that the uplink TFCS and any configured TFC Subset satisfies the following rules:
1>	for each TTI length with which at least one transport channel is configured:
2>	for each combination of TFs for the transport channels configured with this TTI length included in the TFCS:
3>	a TFC with these TFs for the transport channels configured with this TTI length and empty TFs on all transport channels configured with shorter TTI lengths is also included in the TFCS.
For TDD, the TFCS of a CCTrCH should include those of the above combinations, which include a TF with one transport block for a transport channel used in that CCTrCH, and the "empty" TFC should be included in the TFCS of every CCTrCH.
Synchronous TM logical channels are logical channels on which higher layer traffic is generated in a perfectly correlated fashion (e.g. AMR RAB).
NOTE:	The "Configured RLC Size" is defined as the transport block size minus the MAC header size.
8.6.5.3	Transport format combination subset
When configuring a TFC Subset, the UTRAN should follow the guidelines defined in subclause 8.6.5.2.
If the IE "Transport format combination subset"("TFC subset") is included, the UE shall:
1>	if the IE "Minimum allowed Transport format combination index" is included; and
2>	if the value of the IE "Minimum allowed Transport format combination index" is greater than the highest TFCI value in the current transport format combination set:
3>	consider the TFC subset to be incompatible with the current transport format combination set.
1>	if the IE "Allowed transport format combination list" is included; and
2>	if the value of any of the IEs "Allowed transport format combination" included in the IE "Allowed transport format combination list" does not match a TFCI value in the current transport format combination set:
3>	consider the TFC subset to be incompatible with the current transport format combination set.
1>	if the IE "Non-allowed transport format combination list" is included; and
2>	if the value of any of the IEs "Non-allowed transport format combination" included in the IE "Non-allowed transport format combination list" does not match a TFCI value in the current transport format combination set:
3>	consider the TFC subset to be incompatible with the current transport format combination set.
1>	if the IE "Restricted TrCH information" is included:
2>	if the value of any of the IEs "Uplink transport channel type" and "Restricted UL TrCH identity" included in the IE "Restricted TrCH information" do not correspond to any of the transport channels for which the current transport format combination set is valid:
3>	consider the TFC subset to be incompatible with the current transport format combination set.
2>	if the IE "Allowed TFIs" is included; and
3>	if the value of each of the IEs "Allowed TFI" included in the IE "Allowed TFIs" corresponds to a transport format for that transport channel within the current transport format combination set:
4>	allow all transport format combinations that include these transport formats for the transport channel;
4>	restrict all other transport format combinations.
3>	else:
4>	consider the TFC subset to be incompatible with the current transport format combination set.
2>	if the IE "Allowed TFIs" is not included:
3>	restrict all transport format combinations where the transport channel has a transport format of non-zero rate.
1>	if the UE considers the TFC subset to be incompatible with the current Transport format combination set according to the above:
2>	keep any previous restriction of the transport format combination set;
2>	set the variable INVALID_CONFIGURATION to TRUE.
1>	if the UE does not consider the TFC subset to be incompatible with the current Transport format combination set according to the above:
2>	if the IE "Transport format combination subset" is received in a message other than a TRANSPORT FORMAT COMBINATION CONTROL message:
3>	set both the IE "Current TFC subset" and the IE "Default TFC subset" in the variable TFC_SUBSET to the IE "Transport format combination subset" (in case of TDD for the uplink CCTrCH specified by the IE "TFCS Id");
3>	clear the IE "Duration" in the variable TFC_SUBSET;
3>	apply the transport format combination subset in the IE "Current TFC subset" stored in the variable TFC_SUBSET.
1>	if the IE "transport format combination subset" indicates the "full transport format combination set":
2>	set both the IE "Current TFC subset" and the IE "Default TFC subset" in the variable TFC_SUBSET to the value indicating "full transport format combination set";
2>	clear the IE "Duration" in the variable TFC_SUBSET;
2>	if the IE "Transport format combination subset" is received in a TRANSPORT FORMAT COMBINATION CONTROL message, then at the CFN indicated by the IE "Activation time for TFC subset" any restriction on transport format combination set is released and the UE may use the full transport format combination set;
2>	else:
3>	any restriction on transport format combination set is released and the UE may use the full transport format combination set.
8.6.5.4	DCH quality target
If the IE "DCH quality target" is included, the UE shall:
1>	set, at physical channel establishment, the initial downlink target SIR value based on the received IE "DCH quality target" for the transport channel with respect to all transport formats;
1>	adjust the target SIR for the downlink power control to meet the quality target received in the IE "DCH quality target" for the transport channel. The UE shall not compensate for the fact that the required SIR to achieve a target BLER for a particular transport format may be different from the required SIR to achieve the target BLER for another transport format..
NOTE 1:	Adjusting the target SIR is possible to do continuously by the UE if a CRC exists in all transport formats in the downlink TFS for a DCH. If a CRC does not exist in all transport formats, the UE can only adjust the target SIR when receiving transport formats containing a CRC and the UE has knowledge about the transport format according to [27].
NOTE 2:	If the UTRAN configures a UE to use blind transport format detection and configures a transport channel such that single transport format detection [27] must be used to detect the TF, then it is not possible for the UE to maintain a quality target for that transport channel.
8.6.5.5	Added or Reconfigured UL TrCH information
If the IE "Added or Reconfigured UL TrCH information" is included then the UE shall:
1>	for the transport channel identified by the IE "UL Transport Channel Identity" and IE "Uplink transport channel type":
2>	perform the actions for the IE "Transport Format Set" as specified in subclause 8.6.5.1.
NOTE:	The UE stores the UL transport channel configuration until it is explicitly deleted by a message containing the IE "Deleted UL TrCH information" or the UE leaves RRC Connected mode.
1>	if the choice "UL parameters" is set to 'E-DCH':
2>	for FDD:
3>	apply the values of the IE "E-DCH Transmission Time Interval" and the IE "HARQ info for E-DCH" to all E-DCH MAC-d flows.
2>	for TDD:
3>	apply the value of the IE "HARQ info for E-DCH" to all E-DCH MAC-d flows.
2>	for the IE "HARQ Info for E-DCH":
3>	perform the actions specified in subclause 8.6.5.17.
2>	if the IE "Added or Reconfigured E-DCH MAC-d Flow list " is included:
3>	for each MAC-d flow identified by the IE "Mac-d flow identity":

For transmission gap pattern sequences stored in variable TGPS_IDENTITY, but not identified in IE "TGPSI" (either due to the absence of the IE "DPCH compressed mode info" in the received message or due to not receiving the corresponding TGPSI value in the IE "DPCH compressed mode info"), the UE shall:

Uplink and downlink compressed mode methods are described in [27]. For UL "higher layer scheduling" compressed mode method and transport format combination selection, see [15].
8.6.6.16	Repetition period, Repetition length, Offset (TDD only)
In case the physical allocations of different channels overlap the following priority rules shall apply for common channels and shall be taken into account by the UE:
1>	PICH takes precedence over Primary CCPCH;
1>	PICH takes precedence over Secondary CCPCH;
1>	MICH takes precedence over Primary CCPCH;
1>	MICH takes precedence over Secondary CCPCH;
1>	Secondary CCPCH takes precedence over Primary CCPCH.
The frame allocation can be derived by following rules:
If no IE "Offset" is explicitly given, the parameter "Offset" to be used is calculated by the following equation:
	Activation time mod Repetition period = Offset.
Frames from CFN CFNoff to CFNoff + Repetition length - 1 belong to the allocation with CFNoff fulfilling the following equation:
	CFNoff mod Repetition period = Offset.
Repetition length is always a multiple of the largest TTI within the CCTrCH fulfilling the following equation:
	(largest TTI within CCTrCH) * X = Repetition Length
Example of usage:

8.6.7.2	Filter coefficient
If the IE "Filter coefficient" is received the UE shall, depending on the measurement quantity (see Table 8.6.7.2), apply filtering of the measurements for that measurement quantity according to the formula below. This filtering shall be performed by the UE before UE event evaluation. The UE shall depending on the reporting quantity (see Table 8.6.7.2), also filter the measurements reported in the IE "Measured results". The filtering shall not be performed for the measurements reported in the IE "Measured results on RACH" and for cell-reselection in connected or idle mode.
The filtering shall be performed according to the following formula.
	
The variables in the formula are defined as follows:
Fn is the updated filtered measurement result
Fn-1 is the old filtered measurement result
Mn is the latest received measurement result from physical layer measurements, the unit used for Mn is the same unit as the reported unit in the MEASUREMENT REPORT message or the unit used in the event evaluation.
a = 1/2(k/2), where k is the parameter received in the IE "Filter coefficient".
NOTE:	if k is set to 0 that will mean no layer 3 filtering.
In order to initialise the averaging filter, F0 is set to M1 when the first measurement result from the physical layer measurement is received.
The physical layer measurement results are sampled once every measurement period. The measurement period and the accuracy for a certain measurement is defined in [19] and [20].
Table 8.6.7.2 lists for all measurement quantities and reporting quantities if L3-filtering is applicable or not and used L3-filtering type for each measurement quantity.

8.6.7.7	Cell Reporting Quantities
If the IE "Cell Reporting Quantities" is received by the UE, the UE shall store the content of the IE "Cell Reporting Quantities" to the variable MEASUREMENT_IDENTITY.
The UE shall include measured results in MEASUREMENT REPORT as specified in the IE "Cell Reporting Quantities", except for the following cases:
If the IE "Cell Identity" is set to TRUE, the UE shall in this version of the specification:

If the IE "Cell synchronisation information reporting indicator" is set to TRUE, the UE shall:
1>	include the IE "Cell synchronisation information" in MEASUREMENT REPORT as specified in the IE "Cell Reporting Quantities":
2>	if the measurement is performed on another frequency; or

2>	report the IE "Proposed TGSN" indicating the TGSN that suits best to the measured cell;
2>	set the variable TGSN_REPORTED to TRUE.
1>	otherwise
2>	omit the IE "Proposed TGSN".
8.6.7.8	Periodical Reporting Criteria
If the IE "Periodical Reporting Criteria" is received by the UE, the UE shall:
1>	store the contents of the IE "Amount of Reporting" and IE "Reporting interval" in the variable MEASUREMENT_IDENTITY.
For the first MEASUREMENT REPORT message, the UE shall:
1>	send the MEASUREMENT REPORT as soon as all requested reporting quantities are available according to the requirements and the measurement capabilities set in [19] and [20] for at least one measurement object stored in the variable MEASUREMENT_IDENTITY, but never later than one reporting interval after measurement initiation.
Following the first MEASUREMENT REPORT message, the UE shall:
1>	send a MEASUREMENT REPORT message one reporting interval after the previous MEASUREMENT REPORT message;
The first and subsequent  periodic MEASUREMENT REPORT messages shall only include measured results for reporting quantities that are available according to the requirements and the measurement capabilities set in [19] and [20] i.e. if no measured results are available and the measurement type is not UE positioning, the IE "Measured Results" shall not be included in the MEASUREMENT REPORT message. If no measured results are available and the measurement type is UE positioning, the UE shall include the IE "Measured Results" in the MEASUREMENT REPORT message in order to include the IE "UE positioning error" as specified in 8.6.7.19a and 8.6.7.19b.
After the UE has sent a total number of MEASUREMENT REPORT messages, which equal the value indicated in the IE "Amount of reporting", the UE shall:
1>	terminate measurement reporting; and
1>	delete all measurement information linked with the "Measurement identity" of the ongoing measurement from the variable MEASUREMENT_IDENTITY.
If according to subclause 8.6.7.19.1a or 8.6.7.19.1b, a UE configured with a UE positioning measurement is unable to report the requested measurement results due to missing GPS assistance data and sends a MEASUREMENT REPORT containing the IE "UE positioning error" and the IE "Error reason" is set to "Assistance Data Missing", then this is not counted in the total number of MEASUREMENT REPORT messages sent.
8.6.7.9	Reporting Cell Status
If the IE "Reporting Cell Status" is received, the UE shall set the IE "Measured Results" in MEASUREMENT REPORT as follows. The UE shall:
1>	for intra-frequency measurement and inter-frequency measurement:
2>	include the IE "Cell Measured Results" for cells (excluding cells of another RAT) that satisfy the condition (such as "Report cells within active set") specified in the IE "Reporting Cell Status", in descending order by the measurement quantity.
2>	the maximum number of the IE "Cell Measured Results" to be included in the IE "Measured Results" per reported frequency is the number specified in the IE "Reporting Cell Status".
1> for periodic inter-frequency measurement:
2>	include in the IE "Inter-frequency measured results list" the measured results for all non-used frequencies.
1>	for inter-RAT measurement:
2>	include the measurement results for cells of other RAT (e.g., GSM) that satisfy the condition specified in the IE "Reporting Cell Status", in descending order by the measurement quantity.
2>	the maximum number of the IE "Measured GSM Cells" to be included in the IE "Measured Results" is the number specified in the IE "Reporting Cell Status".
If the IE "Reporting Cell Status" is not received for intra-frequency, inter-frequency measurement, or inter-RAT measurement, the UE shall:
1>	for intra-frequency measurement, inter-frequency measurement and inter-RAT measurement:
2>	exclude the IE "Measured Results" in MEASUREMENT REPORT.
NOTE:	The IE "Reporting Cell Status" within "Event Criteria List" defines whether "Cell Measured Results" is present for event-based reporting.
The IE "Reporting Cell Status" is not included in System Information Block 11/12 for periodic intra-frequency measurements. In this case the UE shall assume the default values "Report cells within active set and/or monitored set on used frequency " and "6".

1>	if the value of the "MBMS short transmission ID" is less than or equal to the number of services identified by the IE "Modified services list" included in the MBMS MODIFIED SERVICES INFORMATION message acquired in the same modification period as the one in which the "MBMS short transmission ID" is received:
2>	consider the "MBMS short transmission ID" to be an index to the list of services contained in the IE "Modified services list" and apply the MBMS transmission identity specified for this entry.
1>	otherwise:
2>	compile a list of available MBMS services, as included in the MBMS MODIFIED SERVICES INFORMATION and the MBMS UNMODIFIED SERVICES INFORMATION messages acquired in the same modification period as the one in which the "MBMS short transmission ID" is received:
3>	concatenate the services contained in IE "Modified services list" included in the MBMS MODIFIED SERVICES INFORMATION and the services contained in IE "Unmodified services list" included in the MBMS UNMODIFIED SERVICES INFORMATION.
2>	consider the 'MBMS short transmission ID' to be the index of the entry in the list of available services and apply the MBMS transmission identity specified for this entry.
8.6.9.9	MBMS Transmission identity
If the IE "MBMS transmission identity" is included the UE shall:
1>	if upper layers indicate that the MBMS transmission has already been received correctly:
2>	ignore the information about this MBMS transmission i.e. continue as if the information about the concerned MBMS transmission was not included in the message.
1>	otherwise:
2>	act upon the information about the concerned MBMS transmission as specified elsewhere.
The UE behaviour is unspecified if an MBMS transmission identity appears more than once in the combined list of transmissions i.e. the IE is included more than once in the MBMS MODIFIED SERVICES INFORMATION or in the MBMS UNMODIFIED SERVICES INFORMATION, or once in both message.
8.6.9.9a	MBMS transmission time difference
The IE "MBMS transmission time difference" indicates the time difference between the transmissions on the current and the neighbour cell i.e. indicating the TTIs that can be L1- combined. The UE shall:
1>	derive the parameter Neighbor_Start from the IE MBMS transmission time difference as follows:
	MBMS transmission time difference = (Neighbor_Start / Max_TTI_Size) mod 4
where Neighbor_Start is the CFN of the first radio frame in a TTI on the neighbour cell that may be combined with the TTI on the current cell of which the CFN of the first radio frame equals 0 while Max_TTI_Size is the largest TTI size on the S-CCPCHs to be soft combined;
1>	in case of partial soft combining, derive the CFN of the first radio frame in a TTI on the neighbour cell that may be combined assuming the same time difference applies.
The maximum delay between S-CCPCH clusters that the UE may combine is set by UE performance requirements.
NOTE:	The MBMS transmission time difference is semi-static; it does not vary within or between L1 combining periods nor when full combining is used.
8.6.9.9b	MCCH configuration information
If the IE "MCCH configuration information" is included the UE shall:
1>	Consider an access information period to start from the frame with the SFN value fulfilling the following equation (where m is the modification period coefficient and a is the access info period coefficient):
	SFN mod 2(m – a)  = 0
1>	Consider a repetition period to start from the frame with the SFN value fulfilling the following equation (where m is the modification period coefficient and r is the repetition period coefficient):
	SFN mod 2(m – r)  = 0
1>	Consider a modification period to start from the frame with the SFN value fulfilling the following equation (where m is the modification period coefficient):
	SFN mod 2m = 0
1>	configure the RLC entity in the UE used for receiving MCCH in accordance with 8.6.4.9;
1>	configure the MAC entity in the UE, used for receiving MCCH, for receiving TCTF field unless the IE 'TCTF presence' is received;
8.6.9.10	Next scheduling period
If the IE "Next scheduling period" is included the UE may:
1>	discontinue reception of the S-CCPCH on which the IE was received for the number of scheduling periods indicated by this IE.
8.7	MBMS specific procedures
8.7.1	Reception of MBMS control information
8.7.1.1	General
The procedure for receiving MBMS control information is used by a UE to receive information from UTRAN concerning the way it provides MBMS services the UE has joined. The procedure applies to all UEs supporting MBMS, irrespective of its state (idle, URA_PCH, CELL_PCH, CELL_FACH and CELL_DCH).
Most MBMS control information is provided on the MCCH. The information on MCCH is transmitted using a fixed schedule, which is common for all services. MCCH information other than MBMS Access Information message is transmitted periodically based on a repetition period. This MCCH information is repeated a configurable number of times with exactly the same content; the period in which the content of MCCH information other than MBMS Access Information message remains unchanged is called the modification period. MBMS Access Information message may be transmitted more frequently, based on the Access Info period. The transmissions of MBMS Access Information message within a modification period need not have exactly the same content (the value of some parameters eg. IE 'Access probability factor – Idle' may change). Nevertheless, the transmissions of MBMS Access Information message within a modification period should concern the same MBMS service(s), although information for a service may be removed eg. upon completion of the counting for that service.
The general principles are illustrated in figure 8.7.1-1, in which different colours indicate potentially different content of the MCCH information.

Figure 8.7.1-1: Scheduling of MCCH Information 
For services provided via a p-t-m radio bearer scheduling information may be provided on an MSCH mapped on the same S-CCPCH as the p-t-m radio bearer(s). For some of the services provided p-t-m this scheduling information may be provided by signalling an MBMS Scheduling Information message at every scheduling period, while for others the MBMS Scheduling Information message may be signalled less frequently i.e. after a multiple of the scheduling period. In general, the UE is neither required to acquire MSCH information nor to act on it.
In case the UE shall acquire MCCH information that is scheduled at the same time as MSCH information, the reception of the MCCH information shall take precedence.
In order to minimise the time the UE needs to read MCCH upon notification as specified in 8.7.3 to acquire the required information, UTRAN should schedule the MCCH messages in a specific order ie. any message that needs to be read by any UE due to the reception of the MBMS MODIFIED SERVICES INFORMATION message should be scheduled prior to the remaining messages. More specifically, the UE may assume that UTRAN schedules the MCCH messages in the following order:
MBMS MODIFIED SERVICES INFORMATION,
followed by messages that needs to be read by any UE due to the content of the MBMS MODIFIED SERVICES INFORMATION message  in the following order: MBMS General Information, MBMS Common p-t-m rb InformatioN, MBMS Current Cell p-t-m rb Information, one or more MBMS Neighbouring Cell p-t-m rb Information,
MBMS Unmodified services Information,
followed by messages that do not need to be read by any UE due to the content of the MBMS MODIFIED SERVICES INFORMATION message  in the following order: MBMS General Information, MBMS Common p-t-m rb InformatioN, MBMS Current Cell p-t-m rb Information, one or more MBMS Neighbouring Cell p-t-m rb Information
8.7.1.2	Initiation
The requirements concerning which MBMS control information the UE shall acquire in the different cases is specified in other subclauses. This section specifies common requirements concerning the reception of MCCH information and MSCH information.
8.7.1.3	UE requirements on reading of MCCH information
When requested to acquire MBMS control information other than the MBMS Access Information message , the UE shall:
1>	if requested to start reading MCCH at the next modification period:
2>	start reading MCCH at the beginning of the next modification period.
1>	otherwise
2>	start reading MCCH at the beginning of the next repetition period.
1>	if requested to stop reading MCCH at the end of the modification period:
2>	continue reading MCCH until the required MBMS control information is received or until the UE detects a TTI in which no MCCH information is transmitted, whichever is first;
2>	continue reading MCCH in this manner at every subsequent repetition period, until the information is received correctly or until the end of the modification period.
1>	otherwise:
2>	continue reading MCCH until the required MBMS control information is received or until the UE detects a TTI in which no MCCH information is transmitted, whichever is first;
2>	continue reading MCCH in this manner at every subsequent repetition period, until the information is received correctly.
NOTE 1:	The UE may combine information received at different repetition periods within a modification period.
When requested to acquire the MBMS Access Information message, the UE shall:
1>	if requested to start reading MCCH at the next modification period:
2>	start reading MCCH at the beginning of the next modification period.
1>	otherwise:
2>	start reading MCCH at the beginning of the next access info period.
1>	continue reading MCCH in this manner at every subsequent access info period, until the message is received correctly or until the end of the modification period.
If the UE is CELL_DCH and has a compressed mode pattern that overlaps with the period in which it needs to read MCCH, the UE may temporarily refrain from receiving MCCH unless it is capable of simultaneous operation. If the UE is CELL_FACH and has a measurement occasion that overlaps with the period in which it needs to read MCCH, the UE may temporarily refrain from receiving MCCH unless it is capable of simultaneous operation. A UE in CELL_FACH may omit performing measurements during a measurement occasion in order to receive MCCH provided that this does not prevent it from fulfilling the measurement performance requirements as specified in [19]. In Idle mode as well as in CELL_PCH and URA_PCH states the UE may temporarily refrain from receiving MCCH if needed to fulfil the measurements performance requirements as specified in [19].
NOTE 2:	The UTRAN should endeavour to ensure that for each UE in CELL_FACH the assigned measurement occasions do not overlap constantly with the periodic MCCH transmissions.
If the UE selects to another cell, the UE shall re-establish the RLC entity used for MCCH reception.
8.7.1.4	UE requirements on reading of MSCH information
If the UE supports reception of MSCH, UE shall:
1>	if the UE needs to acquire MCCH information that is transmitted at the same time as the MSCH information and the UE does not support simultaneous reception:
2>	refrain from reading MSCH.
If the UE supports reception of MSCH, UE should:
1>	start reading MSCH at the beginning of the next scheduling period;
1>	continue reading MSCH until the required MBMS control information is received or until the UE detects a TTI in which no MSCH information is transmitted, whichever is first.
8.7.2	MCCH acquisition

Figure 8.7.2-1: MCCH acquisition, normal
8.7.2.1	General
The UE applies the MCCH acquisition procedure to determine the MBMS services available in the cell and to initiate reception of the services that the UE has joined. The procedure applies to all UEs supporting MBMS, irrespective of their state (idle, URA_PCH, CELL_PCH, CELL_FACH and CELL_DCH).
8.7.2.2	Initiation
If the variable MBMS_ACTIVATED_services is not empty, the UE shall apply the MCCH acquisition procedure upon selecting (eg. upon power on) or re- selecting a cell supporting MBMS, upon change of MBMS controlling cell (eg. due to an active set update or hard handover), upon entering UTRA from another RAT, upon release of a MBMS PTP RB for the purpose of changing transfer mode, upon return from loss of coverage and upon receiving an indication from upper layers that the set of activated services has changed.
8.7.2.3	MCCH information to be acquired by the UE
The UE shall detect the available MBMS services by acquiring the MBMS MODIFIED SERVICES INFORMATION and the MBMS UNMODIFIED SERVICES INFORMATION messages without delaying reading of MCCH until the next modification period and without stopping at the end of the modification period, in accordance with subclause 8.7.1.3.
The UE shall immediately acquire the MBMS ACCESS INFORMATION and the MBMS GENERAL INFORMATION messages ie. it shall not delay reception of these messages until it has completed the acquisition of the MBMS MODIFIED SERVICES INFORMATION and the MBMS UNMODIFIED SERVICES INFORMATION messages. Likewise, the UE should immediately acquire the MBMS CURRENT CELL P-T-M RB INFORMATION and MBMS NEIGHBOURING CELL P-T-M RB INFORMATION messages. 
The UE shall continue acquiring the above messages until it has received a consistent set of MCCH information eg. both the MBMS MODIFIED SERVICES INFORMATION and the MBMS UNMODIFIED SERVICES INFORMATION message should be acquired in the same modification period.
8.7.2.4	Reception of the MBMS MODIFIED SERVICES INFORMATION and the MBMS UNMODIFIED SERVICES INFORMATION by the UE
If the UE is receiving an MBMS service that is not included in variable MBMS_ACTIVATED_SERVICES and that is using a p-t-m radio bearer, the UE shall:
1>	stop receiving the concerned MBMS service and clear all service specific information applicable for the concerned service.
Upon completing the reception of the MBMS MODIFIED SERVICES INFORMATION and the MBMS UNMODIFIED SERVICES INFORMATION messages, the UE shall
1>	act as follows for each of the services included in these messages provided that the service is included in variable MBMS_ACTIVATED_SERVICES and upper layers indicate that the session has not yet been received correctly (referred to as 'applicable services');
1>	act upon all received information elements as specified in subclause 8.6, unless specified otherwise in the following;
1>	if one or more preferred frequency applies for the applicable services:
2>	delay acting upon the "MBMS Preferred frequency information" until receiving  the relevant MCCH information i.e. the MBMS GENERAL INFORMATION message;
2>	act upon the "MBMS Preferred frequency information" as specified in subclause 8.6.9.4 for the service(s) that upper layers indicate to have highest priority.
1>	perform the MBMS frequency selection procedure as specified in subclause 8.5.27;
1>	if the UE receives an MBMS service using a p-t-m radio bearer and the received messages do not contain an IE "MBMS required UE action" set to "Acquire PTM RB info" or set to "Acquire counting info– PTM RBs unmodified" for that service then the UE shall:
2>	stop receiving the concerned MBMS service and clear all service specific information applicable for the concerned service.
8.7.2.5	Reception of the other MBMS messages by the UE
Upon receiving the MBMS ACCESS INFORMATION message, the UE shall act as specified in subclause 8.7.4.3.
Upon receiving the MBMS GENERAL INFORMATION message, the UE should store all relevant IEs included in this message. The UE shall also:
1>	act upon all received information elements as specified in subclause 8.6, unless specified otherwise in the following.
Upon receiving the MBMS CURRENT CELL P-T-M RB INFORMATION and MBMS NEIGHBOURING CELL P-T-M RB INFORMATION messages, the UE shall act as specified in subclauses 8.7.5.3 and subclause 8.7.5.4 respectively.
The procedure ends.
8.7.3	MBMS Notification


Figure 8.7.3-1: MBMS notification on MCCH

Figure 8.7.3-2: MBMS notification on DCCH
8.7.3.1	General
The MBMS notification procedure is used by the UE to respond to a notification provided by UTRAN, indicating a change applicable for one or more MBMS services the UE has joined. The procedure applies to all UEs supporting MBMS, irrespective of their state (idle and connected mode: URA_PCH, CELL_PCH, CELL_FACH and CELL_DCH). The actual notification mechanism to be used depends on the UE state.
8.7.3.2	Initiation
UTRAN initiates the notification procedure to inform UEs about a change applicable for one or more MBMS services available in a cell. Some types of MBMS service changes e.g. the establishment of a p-t-m radio bearer, involve a modification of MCCH messages other than the MBMS MODIFIED SERVICES INFORMATION message.
NOTE 1:	On MCCH, the MBMS MODIFIED SERVICES INFORMATION as well as the MBMS UNMODIFIED SERVICES INFORMATION messages are signalled even if no services are contained in the message.
NOTE 2:	A service remains in the MBMS MODIFIED SERVICES INFORMATION message until it enters a 'steady state', upon which it moves to the MBMS UNMODIFIED SERVICES INFORMATION message. In case counting is used, the service remains in the MBMS MODIFIED SERVICES INFORMATION message through the moment UTRAN has decided the transfer mode.
8.7.3.3	Receiving the MBMS Notification information
8.7.3.3.1	Reception via MCCH
The UE may:
1>	if not receiving an MBMS service provided via a p-t-m radio bearer; or
1>	if receiving an MBMS service provided via a p-t-m radio bearer that has scheduling information for that service on MSCH:
2>	monitor the MBMS notification Indicator Channel (MICH).
2>	if a notification on the MICH for one or more of the MBMS services included in the variable MBMS_ACTIVATED_SERVICES is detected:
3>	acquire the MBMS MODIFIED SERVICES INFORMATION message with delaying the reading of MCCH until the next modification period and with stopping at the end of the modification period, in accordance with subclause 8.7.1.3;
3>	handle the MBMS MODIFIED SERVICES INFORMATION message as specified in subclause 8.7.3.4.
The UE shall:
1>	if in idle mode, URA_PCH, CELL_PCH or CELL_FACH state:
2>	if receiving an MBMS service provided via a p-t-m radio bearer that does not have scheduling information for that service on MSCH; or
2>	if receiving an MBMS service provided via a p-t-m radio bearer that has scheduling information for that service on MSCH, and not monitoring MICH; or
2>	if not receiving an MBMS service that is provided via a p-t-m radio bearer and not monitoring MICH:
3>	acquire the MBMS MODIFIED SERVICES INFORMATION message from MCCH at the start of every modification period, in accordance with subclause 8.7.1.3;
3>	handle the MBMS MODIFIED SERVICES INFORMATION message as specified in subclause 8.7.3.4.
1>	if in CELL_DCH state:
2>	if receiving an MBMS service that is provided via a p-t-m radio bearer:
3>	acquire the MBMS MODIFIED SERVICES INFORMATION message from MCCH at the start of every modification period, in accordance with subclause 8.7.1.3;
3>	handle the MBMS MODIFIED SERVICES INFORMATION message as specified in subclause 8.7.3.4.
8.7.3.3.2	Void

8.7.3.3.3	Reception via DCCH
Notification via DCCH is used to notify the UE about the start of a session for which a PL applies, to notify the UE about the establishment of a p-t-m radio bearer and to request a UE in PMM_idle state to establish a PMM connection to enable reception of a service provided via a p-t-p radio bearer.
Upon receiving the MBMS MODIFIED SERVICES INFORMATION message via DCCH, a UE in CELL_DCH shall:
1>	handle the MBMS MODIFIED SERVICES INFORMATION message as specified in subclause 8.7.3.4.
8.7.3.4	UE action upon receiving MBMS MODIFIED SERVICES INFORMATION message
Upon receiving the MBMS MODIFIED SERVICES INFORMATION message, the UE shall act as follows for each of the services included in this messages provided that the service is included in variable MBMS_ACTIVATED_SERVICES and upper layers indicate that the session has not yet been received correctly (referred to as 'applicable services'):
1>	if the IE "MBMS all unmodified p-t-m services" is included in the MBMS MODIFIED SERVICES INFORMATION messages:
2>	for all services listed in the message UNMODIFIED SERVICES INFORMATION, provided that the service is included in variable MBMS_ACTIVATED_SERVICES, upper layers indicate that the session has not yet been received correctly (referred to as 'applicable services') and the IE "MBMS required UE action" in the message MBMS Unmodified services Information is set to "Acquire PTM RB info":
3>	continue acquiring the MBMS Unmodified services Information, MBMS COMMON P-T-M RB INFORMATION, MBMS CURRENT CELL P-T-M RB INFORMATION, and the MBMS NEIGHBOURING CELL P-T-M RB INFORMATION messages without delaying reading of MCCH until the next modification period and without stopping at the end of the modification period, in accordance with subclause 8.7.1.3;
3>	act upon the MBMS Unmodified services Information MBMS COMMON P-T-M RB INFORMATION, MBMS CURRENT CELL P-T-M RB INFORMATION and the MBMS NEIGHBOURING CELL P-T-M RB INFORMATION message, if received, in accordance with subclause 8.7.5, and assuming the p-t-m configuration indicated in these messages is valid from the start of the next modification period, unless the IE "MBMS p-t-m activation time" is included in the MBMS MODIFIED SERVICES INFORMATION message.
2>	if the UE receives an MBMS service using a p-t-m radio bearer and the messages MBMS UNMODIFIED SERVICES INFORMATION and MBMS MODIFIED SERVICES INFORMATION do not contain an IE "MBMS required action" set to "Acquire PTM RB info" or set to "Acquire counting info – PTM RBs unmodified" for that service then the UE shall:
3>	stop receiving the concerned MBMS service and clear all service specific information applicable for the concerned service.
1>	act upon all received information elements as specified in subclause 8.6, unless specified otherwise in the following
1>	if one or more preferred frequency applies for the applicable services:
2>	acquire the MBMS GENERAL INFORMATION message.
1>	perform the MBMS frequency selection procedure as specified in subclause 8.5.27;
1>	the procedure ends.
8.7.3.5	UE fails to receive MBMS Notification information
If the UE fails to receive the MBMS MODIFIED SERVICES INFORMATION message within the current modification period,  the UE shall:
1>	Acquire the MBMS MODIFIED SERVICES INFORMATION and the MBMS UNMODIFIED SERVICES INFORMATION messages without delaying reading of MCCH until the next modification period and with stopping at the end of that modification period, in accordance with subclause 8.7.1.3;
1>	act upon the received MBMS MODIFIED SERVICES INFORMATION and the MBMS UNMODIFIED SERVICES INFORMATION messages as specified in subclause 8.7.2.4.
8.7.4	MBMS counting

Figure 8.7.4-1: MBMS counting, normal
8.7.4.1	General
The MBMS counting procedure is used by the UE to inform UTRAN about its interest to receive an MBMS transmission. The procedure applies to UEs supporting MBMS that are in idle mode or in connected mode. In connected mode the procedure applies to the URA_PCH, Cell_PCH and/ or Cell_FACH states dependent upon the value of the IE "Connected mode counting scope".
8.7.4.2	Initiation
The UE initiates the MBMS counting procedure for an MBMS transmission upon receiving an MBMS MODIFIED SERVICES message including IE "MBMS required UE action" with the value set to 'Acquire counting info' or set to "Acquire counting info– PTM RBs unmodified".
8.7.4.3	Reception of the MBMS ACCESS INFORMATION
The UE shall acquire the MBMS ACCESS INFORMATION message without delaying reading of MCCH until the next modification period in accordance with subclause 8.7.1.3. If the procedure the UE would apply to respond to counting (Idle mode: RRC connection establishment,  connected mode: Cell update) is ongoing, the UE may defer acquiring the MBMS ACCESS INFORMATION message until this procedure has completed.
The UE behaviour upon receiving an MBMS ACCESS INFORMATION message that is contained in more than one TTI is not specified.
Upon receiving the MBMS ACCESS INFORMATION message including one or more MBMS service(s) it has joined and/or including one or more MBMS Selected Services, the UE shall for each joined and/or selected service:
1>	if the UE is in idle mode:
2>	draw a random number, "rand", uniformly distributed in the range: 0 ≤ rand < 1
2>	if 'rand' is lower than the value indicated by the IE 'Access probability factor-Idle' for the concerned service:
3>	indicate to upper layers that establishment of an RRC connection is required to receive the concerned MBMS service, with the establishment cause set to 'MBMS reception';
3>	if the above condition applies for more than one service, initiate a single indication to upper layers;
3>	if the RRC connection establishment succeeds, the procedure ends.
2>	otherwise:
3>	if the message triggering the MBMS counting procedure included the IE "Continue MCCH reading" with a value set to TRUE:
4>	continue acquiring further MBMS ACCESS INFORMATION messages without delaying reading of MCCH until the next modification period and without stopping at the end of the modification period, in accordance with subclause 8.7.1.3.
3>	otherwise:
4>	continue acquiring further MBMS ACCESS INFORMATION messages without delaying reading of MCCH until the next modification period and with stopping at the end of the modification period, in accordance with subclause 8.7.1.3.
1>	if the UE is in URA_PCH state, Cell_PCH or Cell_FACH state and the IE "Connected mode counting scope" indicates that counting is applicable for this UE state:
2>	draw a random number, "rand", uniformly distributed in the range: 0 ≤ rand < 1.
2>	if 'rand' is lower than the value indicated by the IE 'Access probability factor-connected' for the concerned service:
3>	if a cell update has not been successfully transmitted for this service in the current modification period:
4>	initiate the cell update procedure with 'Cell update cause' set to "MBMS reception", in accordance with subclause 8.3.1;
4>	if the above condition applies for more than one service, initiate a single cell update;
4>	if the cell update procedure succeeds, 
5>	the procedure ends.
2>	otherwise:
3>	if the message triggering the MBMS counting procedure included the IE "Continue MCCH reading" with a value set to TRUE:
4>	continue acquiring further MBMS ACCESS INFORMATION messages without delaying reading of MCCH until the next modification period and without stopping at the end of the modification period, in accordance with subclause 8.7.1.3.
3>	otherwise:
4>	continue acquiring further MBMS ACCESS INFORMATION messages without delaying reading of MCCH until the next modification period and with stopping at the end of the modification period, in accordance with subclause 8.7.1.3.
1>	otherwise:
2>	the procedure ends;
Upon receiving the MBMS ACCESS INFORMATION message not including an MBMS service(s) the UE has joined:
1>	the procedure ends;
8.7.4.4	Termination of the MBMS counting procedure
If the UE detects that the MBMS ACCESS INFORMATION message is not provided at an access info period; OR
If the UE receives an MBMS ACCESS INFORMATION message not including an MBMS service the UE has joined, the UE shall:
1>	terminate the MBMS counting procedure.
8.7.4.5	Failure of the counting response procedure
If the counting response procedure (RRC connection establishment or Cell update) fails, the UE shall:
1>	if the failure occurs in the same modification period as the one in which the UE initiated the counting response procedure; or
1>	if the message triggering the MBMS counting procedure included the IE "Continue MCCH reading" with a value set to TRUE that is applicable in the modification period in which the UE detects the failure:
2>	continue acquiring further MBMS ACCESS INFORMATION messages without delaying reading of MCCH until the next modification period and without stopping at the end of the modification period, in accordance with subclause 8.7.1.3.
1>	otherwise:
2>	the procedure ends.
8.7.5	MBMS p-t-m radio bearer configuration

Figure 8.7.5-1: MBMS p-t-m radio bearer modification, normal
8.7.5.1	General
The MBMS p-t-m radio bearer configuration procedure is used by the UE to acquire the (modified) radio bearer configuration for one or more MBMS services the UE has joined. The procedure applies to all UEs supporting MBMS, irrespective of their state (idle and connected mode: URA_PCH, CELL_PCH, CELL_FACH and CELL_DCH).
8.7.5.2	Initiation
The UE applies the MBMS p-t-m radio bearer configuration procedure whenever it detects that one of the services it has joined is provided by means of a p-t-m radio bearerer. This may occur as part of the MCCH acquisition or the MBMS Notification procedure.
8.7.5.3	Reception of the MBMS Current Cell PTM RB information
Upon completing the reception of the MBMS COMMON P-T-M RB INFORMATION and the MBMS CURRENT CELL P-T-M RB INFORMATION messages for an MBMS service it has joined, the UE shall:
1>	if the UE is already receiving an MTCH and does not have the capability to receive the new service in addition:
2>	the UE behaviour is undefined.
NOTE:	In this case, the UE may request upper layers to prioritise the services and only receive the service(s) prioritised by upper layers.
1>	act upon all received information elements as specified in subclause 8.6, unless specified otherwise in the following;
1>	if the UE previously received the service by means of a p-t-m radio bearer from a cell belonging to another MBMS cell group:
2>	re-establish RLC;
2>	re-initialise PDCP.
1>	start immediately to use the indicated configuration unless specified otherwise;
1>	start or continue receiving the indicated p-t-m radio bearers depending on its UE capabilities.
The UE shall continue acquiring the above messages until it has received a consistent set of MCCH information i.e. the MBMS Modified services Information message, MBMS Unmodified services Information message, MBMS COMMON P-T-M RB INFORMATION and the MBMS CURRENT CELL P-T-M RB INFORMATION message should be acquired in the same modification period.
8.7.5.4	Reception of the MBMS Neighbouring Cell PTM RB information
Upon receiving the MBMS NEIGHBOURING CELL P-T-M RB INFORMATION message for an MBMS service it has joined, the UE shall
1>	start immediately to use the indicated neighbouring cells and configuration, or a subset of them, for L1- or L2 combining unless specified otherwise;
1>	start or continue receiving the indicated p-t-m radio bearers from the selected neighbouring cells depending on its UE capabilities.
The UE shall apply MBMS NEIGHBOURING CELL P-T-M RB INFORMATION only in combination with an MBMS Modified services Information message, MBMS Unmodified services Information message, MBMS COMMON P-T-M RB INFORMATION and MBMS CURRENT CELL P-T-M RB INFORMATION message acquired in the same modification period.
8.7.6	MBMS modification request

Figure 8.7.6-1: MBMS modification request, normal
8.7.6.1	General
The MBMS modification request procedure is used by the UE to request UTRAN to release the p-t-p radio bearers ofone or more MBMS services the UE is receiving. The procedure is also used to request to be moved to a preferred frequency applicable for one or more (prioritised) MBMS services the UE has joined, and to indicate the UE MBMS Selected Services. The procedure applies to all UEs supporting MBMS, that are in CELL_DCH, CELL_PCH, URA_PCH or CELL_FACH state.
8.7.6.2	Initiation
A UE entering CELL_DCH shall initiate the MBMS modification request procedure in the following cases:
1>	if the UE has any MBMS Selected Service; and
1>	if the IE "MCCH configuration information" was received in System Information Block Type 5 or System Information Block Type 5bis prior to entering CELL_DCH.
A UE completing an RRC Connection Setup procedure shall initiate the MBMS modification request procedure in the following cases:
1>	if the UE has any MBMS Selected Service; and
1>	if the IE "MCCH configuration information" was received in System Information Block Type 5 or System Information Block Type 5bis prior to completing the RRC Connection Setup procedure.
A UE in CELL_DCH shall initiate the MBMS modification request procedure in the following cases:
1>	the preferred frequency applicable for the  MBMS service prioritised by upper layers is different from the currently used frequency;
1>	upper layers request to discontinue reception of an MBMS service provided via a p-t-p radio bearer e.g. because this inhibits reception of a higher priority service;
1>	upon a change in selection of the MBMS Selected Services.
NOTE:	The above case may occur upon receiving a dedicated notification or in other cases eg. a change of transfer mode from p-t-p to p-t-m for the UE's highest priority MBMS service.
A UE in CELL_FACH, CELL_PCH or URA_PCH state shall initiate the MBMS modification request procedure in the following cases:
1>	upon a change in selection of the MBMS Selected Services that are indicated on MCCH; and
1>	if the IE "Indicate changes in MBMS Selected Services" that is included in the MBMS GENERAL INFORMATION message is set to TRUE.
If the UE is required to initiate the MBMS modification request procedure as specified in the conditions above, the UE shall:
1>	transmit an MBMS MODIFICATION REQUEST message with the contents as specified in subclause 8.7.6.2a.
If applicable, the UE shall use a single MBMS MODIFICATION REQUEST message to request a move to the preferred frequency and/or to request release of radio bearers corresponding with lower priority MBMS services provided p-t-p and/or to report the MBMS Selected Services.
8.7.6.2a	MBMS MODIFICATION REQUEST message contents to set
The UE shall set the contents of the MBMS MODIFICATION REQUEST message as follows:
1>	if the preferred frequency applicable for the  MBMS service prioritised by upper layers is different from the currently used frequency:
2>	include the IE "MBMS preferred frequency request" and set it to the prioritised MBMS service identity;
1>	if upper layers request to discontinue reception of an MBMS service provided via a p-t-p radio bearer:
2>	include the p-t-p radio bearers used for the corresponding MBMS services within the IE "MBMS RB list requested to be released".
1>	if the UE enters CELL_DCH; or
1>	if the UE completes the RRC connection establishment procedure; or
1>	if there is a change in selection of one or more of the MBMS Selected Services:
2>	if the UE has not selected any MBMS Selected Service:
3>	include the MBMS Selected Service Info and set the Status to 'None'.
2>	otherwise:
3>	include the MBMS Selected Service Info and set the Status to 'Some';
3>	for each MBMS Selected Service:
4>	include the MBMS Selected Service ID.
8.7.6.3	Reception of a MBMS MODIFICATION REQUEST message by the UTRAN
Upon reception of a MBMS MODIFICATION REQUEST message, the UTRAN may take further action depending on the contents of the received message.
The procedure ends.
8.7.7	MBMS service scheduling

Figure 8.7.7-1: MBMS service scheduling, normal
8.7.7.1	General
The MBMS service scheduling procedure is used by the UE that is receiving one or more MBMS services that the UE has joined to acquire the MBMS scheduling information for the MBMS services. The procedure applies to all UEs that are receiving an MBMS service provided via a p-t-m radio bearer, irrespective of their state (idle and connected mode: URA_PCH, CELL_PCH, CELL_FACH and CELL_DCH).
8.7.7.2	Initiation
The UE may initiate the MBMS service scheduling procedure for any scheduling period of the concerned MBMS service while receiving an SCCPCH carrying an MBMS service.
8.7.7.3	Reception of the MBMS scheduling information
Upon receiving the MBMS SCHEDULING INFORMATION message, the UE should:
1>	act as follows for each of the services included in these messages provided that the service is included in variable MBMS_ACTIVATED_SERVICES;
1>	act upon all received information elements as specified in subclause 8.6, unless specified otherwise in the following.
The procedure ends.
9	Handling of unknown, unforeseen and erroneous protocol data
9.1	General
This subclause specifies procedures for the handling of unknown, unforeseen, and erroneous protocol data by the receiving entity. These procedures are called "error handling procedures", but in addition to provide recovery mechanisms for error situations they define a compatibility mechanism for future extensions of the protocol.
The error handling procedures specified in this subclause shall apply to all RRC messages. When there is a specific handling for messages received on different logical channels this is specified.
For system information received on the BCCH, the error handling procedures are applied on the BCCH message SYSTEM INFORMATION, the re-assembled system information segments as well as the system information blocks (including the master information block and the scheduling blocks), with specific error handling as specified below.
When the UE receives an RRC message, it shall set the variable PROTOCOL_ERROR_REJECT to FALSE and then perform the checks in the order as defined below.
The error cases specified in the following include the handling upon reception of spare values. This behaviour also applies in case the actual value of the IE results from mapping the originally sent IE value. Moreover, in certain error cases, as specified in the following, default values apply. In this case, the default values specified within the ASN.1, the tabular and the procedure specifications apply.
9.2	ASN.1 violation or encoding error
If the UE receives an RRC message on the DCCH for which the encoded message does not result in any valid abstract syntax value [49] (or "encoding error"), it shall perform the following. The UE shall:
1>	set the variable PROTOCOL_ERROR_REJECT to TRUE;
1>	transmit an RRC STATUS message on the uplink DCCH. The IE "Protocol error information" shall contain an IE "Protocol error cause" set to "ASN.1 violation or encoding error";
1>	when RRC STATUS message has been submitted to lower layers for transmission:
2>	continue with any ongoing processes and procedures as if the invalid message had not been received.
NOTE	In this case, the UE does not perform procedure specific error handling according to clause 8.
If the UE receives an RRC message sent via a radio access technology other than UTRAN, for which the encoded message does not result in any valid abstract syntax, the UE shall:
1>	set the variable PROTOCOL_ERROR_REJECT to TRUE;
1>	set the IE "Protocol error cause" in the variable PROTOCOL_ERROR_INFORMATION to "ASN.1 violation or encoding error";
1>	perform procedure specific error handling according to clause 8.
If a reassembled set of system information segments received in messages on the BCCH does not result in any valid abstract syntax value, the UE shall:
1>	ignore the reassembled set of system information segments;
1>	treat the rest of each message containing the ignored system information segments as if those segments were not present.
If the UE receives an RRC message on the BCCH, PCCH, CCCH, MCCH, MSCH or SHCCH for which the encoded message does not result in any valid abstract syntax value, it shall ignore the message.
9.3	Unknown or unforeseen message type
If a UE receives an RRC message on the DCCH with a message type not defined for the DCCH it shall:
1>	set the variable PROTOCOL_ERROR_REJECT to TRUE;
1>	transmit an RRC STATUS message on the uplink DCCH. The IE "Protocol error information" shall contain an IE "Protocol error cause" set to "Message type non-existent or not implemented";
1>	when the RRC STATUS message has been submitted to lower layers for transmission:
2>	continue with any ongoing processes and procedures as if the invalid message had not been received.
If the UE receives an RRC message on the BCCH, PCCH, CCCH, MCCH, MSCH or SHCCH with a message type not defined for the logical channel type the message was received on, it shall ignore the message.
9.3a	Unsolicited received message
If the UE receives any of the following messages:
-	an RRC CONNECTION SETUP message addressed to the UE on the CCCH; or
-	an RRC CONNECTION REJECT message addressed to the UE on the CCCH; or
-	a UE CAPABILITY INFORMATION CONFIRM message on the DCCH; or
-	a CELL UPDATE CONFIRM message addressed to the UE on the CCCH or on the DCCH; or
-	a URA UPDATE CONFIRM message addressed to the UE on the CCCH or on the DCCH
and no procedure is ongoing according to clause 8 which expects the message to be received:
the UE shall:
1>	ignore the received message.
9.3b	Unexpected critical message extension
If the UE receives an RRC message on the DCCH, or addressed to the UE on the CCCH or on the SHCCH, or sent via a radio access technology other than UTRAN, containing an undefined critical message extension, the UE shall:
1>	set the variable PROTOCOL_ERROR_REJECT to TRUE;
1>	set the IE "Protocol error cause" in the variable PROTOCOL_ERROR_INFORMATION to "Message extension not comprehended";
1>	if the IE "Message Type" of the received message is not present in the table "Rejected transactions" in the variable TRANSACTIONS:
2>	store the IE "Message type" of the received message in the table "Rejected transactions" in the variable TRANSACTIONS; and
2>	set the IE "RRC transaction identifier" to zero in that table entry.
1>	perform procedure specific error handling according to clause 8.
If the UE receives an RRC message on the BCCH, MCCH, MSCH or PCCH, containing an undefined critical message extension, the UE shall:
1>	ignore the message.
9.4	Unknown or unforeseen information element value, mandatory information element
If the UE receives an RRC message on the DCCH, or addressed to the UE on the CCCH or on the SHCCH, or sent via a radio access technology other than UTRAN, with a mandatory IE having a value, including choice, reserved for future extension (spare) or a value not used in this version of the specification (e.g. a dummy value), the UE shall:
1>	if a default value of the IE is defined:
2>	treat the rest of the message using the default value of the IE.
1>	if no default value of the IE is defined:
2>	set the variable PROTOCOL_ERROR_REJECT to TRUE;
2>	set the IE "Protocol error cause" in the variable PROTOCOL_ERROR_INFORMATION to "Information element value not comprehended";
2>	perform procedure specific error handling according to clause 8.
If the UE receives a system information block on the BCCH with a mandatory IE having a value reserved for future extension (spare)or a value not used in this version of the specification (e.g. a dummy value), the UE shall:
1>	if a default value of the IE is defined:
2>	treat the rest of the system information block using the default value of the IE.
1>	if no default value of the IE is defined:
2>	ignore the system information block.
If the UE receives an RRC message on the BCCH, MCCH, MSCH or PCCH with a mandatory IE having a value reserved for future extension (spare) or a value not used in this version of the specification (e.g. a dummy value), the UE shall:
1>	if a default value of the IE is defined:
2>	treat the rest of the message using the default value of the IE.
1>	if no default value of the IE is defined:
2>	ignore the message.
9.5	Conditional information element error
If the UE receives an RRC message on the DCCH, BCCH, PCCH, MCCH, MSCH or addressed to the UE on the CCCH or on the SHCCH, or sent via a radio access technology other than UTRAN, for which the specified conditions for absence of a conditional IE are met and that IE is present, the UE shall:
1>	ignore the IE;
1>	treat the rest of the message as if the IE was not present.
If the UE receives an RRC message on the DCCH, or addressed to the UE on the CCCH or on the SHCCH, or sent via a radio access technology other than UTRAN, for which the specified conditions for presence of a conditional IE are met and that IE is absent, the UE shall:
1>	set the variable PROTOCOL_ERROR_REJECT to TRUE;
1>	set the IE "Protocol error cause" in the variable PROTOCOL_ERROR_INFORMATION to " Information element missing";
1>	perform procedure specific error handling according to clause 8.
If the UE receives a system information block on the BCCH for which the specified conditions for presence of a conditional IE are met and that IE is absent, the UE shall:
1>	ignore the system information block.
If the UE receives an RRC message on the BCCH, MCCH, MSCH or PCCH for which the specified conditions for presence of a conditional IE are met and that IE is absent, the UE shall:
1>	ignore the message.
9.6	Unknown or unforeseen information element value, conditional information element
If the UE receives an RRC message on the DCCH, or addressed to the UE on the CCCH or on the SHCCH, or sent via a radio access technology other than UTRAN, for which the specified conditions for presence of a conditional IE are met, that IE is present, and that IE has a value, including choice, reserved for future extension (spare) or a value not used in this version of the specification (e.g. a dummy value), the UE shall:
1>	if a default value of the IE is defined:
2>	treat the rest of the message using the default value of the IE.
1>	if no default value of the IE is defined:
2>	set the variable PROTOCOL_ERROR_REJECT to TRUE;
2>	set the IE "Protocol error cause" in the variable PROTOCOL_ERROR_INFORMATION to "Information element value not comprehended";
2>	perform procedure specific error handling according to clause 8.
If the UE receives a system information block on the BCCH for which the specified conditions for presence of a conditional IE are met, that IE is present, and that IE has a value, including choice, reserved for future extension (spare) or a value not used in this version of the specification (e.g. a dummy value), the UE shall:

1>	if a default value of the IE is defined:
2>	treat the rest of the message using the default value of the IE.
1>	if no default value of the IE is defined:
2>	ignore the message.
9.7	Unknown or unforeseen information element value, optional information element
If the UE receives an RRC message on the DCCH, or addressed to the UE on the CCCH or on the SHCCH, or sent via a radio access technology other than UTRAN, with an optional IE having a value, including choice, reserved for future extension (spare) or a value not used in this version of the specification (e.g. a dummy value), it shall:
1>	ignore the value of the IE;
1>	treat the rest of the message as if the IE was not present.
If the UE receives a system information block on the BCCH with an optional IE having a value, including choice, reserved for future extension (spare) or a value not used in this version of the specification (e.g. a dummy value), it shall:

1>	ignore the value of the IE;
1>	treat the rest of the message as if the IE was not present.
9.8	Unexpected non-critical message extension
If the UE receives an RRC message on the DCCH, or addressed to the UE on the CCCH or on the SHCCH, or sent via a radio access technology other than UTRAN, containing an undefined non-critical message extension, the UE shall:
1>	if the non critical extension is included in the "Variable Length Extension Container":
2>	ignore the content of the extension and the contents of this container after the not comprehended extension, and continue decoding the rest of the message.
1>	otherwise:
2>	ignore the content of the extension and the message contents after the extension, but treat the parts of the message up to the extension normally.
If the UE receives a system information block on the BCCH containing an undefined non-critical message extension, the UE shall:
1>	ignore the content of the extension and the system information block contents after the extension, but treat the parts of the system information block up to the extension normally.
If the UE receives an RRC message on the BCCH, MCCH or MSCH or PCCH, containing an undefined non-critical message extension, the UE shall:
1>	ignore the content of the extension and the message contents after the extension, but treat the parts of the message up to the extension normally.
9.9	Handling of errors in nested information elements
An erroneous IE may be included in another IE, which may be included in another IE and so on. This subclause specifies the handling of errors in mandatory IEs as well as for conditional IEs for which the specified conditions for presence are met, that are nested in another IE.
In case the UE receives an IE (IE1) that includes a mandatory IE (IE1-1) having a value, including choice, reserved for future extension (spare) or a value not used in this version of the specification (e.g. a dummy value), the UE shall:
1>	consider IE1 to have an undefined value; and
1>	apply the corresponding generic error handling to IE1.
In case there are many IE nesting levels, in all of which the IE is mandatory while no default value is defined, this treatment may need to be repeated several times. The following example illustrates the general principle.
ExampleMessage ::=                  SEQUENCE {
    ie1                                 IE1                               OPTIONAL,
    ie2                                 IE2
}
IE1 ::=					             SEQUENCE {
    ie1-1							    INTEGER (1..16),
    -- ie1-1 values 13..16 are spare and should not be used in this version of the protocol
    ie1-2                               IE1-2                            OPTIONAL,
    ie1-3                               IE1-3
}

If in the above example, UTRAN would include ie1 and set ie1-1 to value 13, the UE experiences an error in a mandatory IE. The guideline outlined in the previous then means that the UE shall not discard the entire message but instead consider "ie1" to have an unknown value. Since IE1 is optional, the generic error handling would be to ignore "ie1".
In case the UE receives an IE (IE1) that includes a list of another IE (IE1-1) for which one or more entries in the list have a value, including choice, reserved for future extension (spare) or a value not used in this version of the specification (e.g. a dummy value), the UE shall:
1>	consider the list as if these entries were not included.
NOTE:	In case the above generic error handling procedures do not result in the desired behaviour, the introduction of spares may need to be reconsidered.
10	Message and information element functional definition and content
10.1	General
The function of each Radio Resource Control message together with message contents in the form of a list of information elements is defined in subclause 10.2.
Functional definitions of the information elements are then described in subclause 10.3.
Information elements are marked as either MP - Mandatory present, MD - Mandatory with default value, OP - Optional, CV - Conditional on value or CH - Conditional on history (see Table 10.1 with information extracted from [14]).
Table 10.1: Meaning of abbreviations used in RRC messages and information elements
Abbreviation
Meaning
MP
Mandatory present
A value for that information is always needed, and no information is provided about a particular default value. If ever the transfer syntax allows absence (e.g., due to extension), then absence leads to an error diagnosis.
MD
Mandatory with default value
A value for that information is always needed, and a particular default value is mentioned (in the 'Semantical information' column). This opens the possibility for the transfer syntax to use absence or a special pattern to encode the default value.
CV
Conditional on value
The need for a value for that information depends on the value of some other IE or IEs, and/or on the message flow (e.g., channel, SAP). The need is specified by means of a condition, the result of which may be that the information is mandatory present, mandatory with default value, not needed or optional.
If one of the results of the condition is that the information is mandatory present, the transfer syntax must allow for the presence of the information. If in this case the information is absent an error is diagnosed.
If one of the results of the condition is that the information is mandatory with default value, and a particular default value is mentioned (in the 'Semantical information' column), the transfer syntax may use absence or a special pattern to encode the default value.
If one of the results of the condition is that the information is not needed, the transfer syntax must allow encoding the absence. If in this case the information is present, it will be ignored. In specific cases however, an error may be diagnosed instead.
If one of the results of the condition is that the information is optional, the transfer syntax must allow for the presence of the information. In this case, neither absence nor presence of the information leads to an error diagnosis.
CH
Conditional on history
The need for a value for that information depends on information obtained in the past (e.g., from messages received in the past from the peer). The need is specified by means of a condition, the result of which may be that the information is mandatory present, mandatory with default value, not needed or optional.
The handling of the conditions is the same as described for CV.
OP
Optional
The presence or absence is significant and modifies the behaviour of the receiver. However whether the information is present or not does not lead to an error diagnosis.

10.1.1	Protocol extensions
RRC messages may be extended in future versions of this protocol, either by adding values for choices, enumerated and size constrained types or by adding information elements. An important aspect concerns the behaviour of a UE, conforming to this revision of the standard, upon receiving a not comprehended future extension. The details of this error handling behaviour are provided in clause 9.
NOTE 1:	By avoiding the need for partial decoding (skipping uncomprehended IEs to continue decoding the remainder of the message), the RRC protocol extension mechanism also avoids the overhead of length determinants for extensions. "Variable length extension containers" (i.e. non critical extension containers that have their abstract syntax defined using the ASN.1 type "BIT STRING") have been defined to support the introduction of extensions to a release after the subsequent release is frozen (and UEs based on that subsequent release may appear). For this container a length determinant is used, which facilitates partial decoding of the container as well as the decoding of the extensions included after the container.
Two kinds of protocol extensions are distinguished: non-critical and critical extensions. In general, a receiver shall process a message including not comprehended non-critical extensions as if the extensions were absent. However, a receiver shall entirely reject a message including not comprehended critical extensions (there is no partial rejection) and notify the sender, as specified in clause 9.
The general mechanism for adding critical extensions is by defining a new version of the message, which is indicated at the beginning of the message.
The UE shall always comprehend the complete transfer syntax specified for the protocol version it supports; if the UE comprehends the transfer syntax defined within protocol version A for message 1, it shall also comprehend the transfer syntax defined within protocol version A for message 2.
The following table shows for which messages only non-critical extensions may be added while for others both critical and non-critical extensions may be added.
NOTE 2:	Critical extensions can only be added to certain downlink messages.

NOTE 3:	For the SYSTEM INFORMATION message protocol extensions are only possible at the level of system information blocks.
10.1.1.1	Non-critical extensions
10.1.1.1.1	Extension of an information element with additional values or choices
In future versions of this protocol, non-critical values may be added to choices, enumerated and size constrained types.
For choices, enumerated and size constrained types it is possible to indicate how many non-critical spare values need to be reserved for future extension. In this case, the tabular format should indicate the number of spare values that are needed. The value range defined in ASN.1 for the extensible IE should include the number of spares that are needed, since a value outside the range defined for this IE will result in a general ASN.1 violation error.
For downlink messages, spare values may be defined for non-critical information elements for which the need is specified to be MD or OP (or CV case leading to MD or OP). In this case, a receiver not comprehending the received spare value shall consider the information element to have the default value or consider it to be absent respectively.
For uplink messages spare values may be defined for all information elements, including those for which the need is specified to be MP (or CV case leading to MP).
In all cases at most one spare should be defined for choices. In this case, information elements applicable to the spare choices shall be added to the end of the message.
10.1.1.1.2	Extension of a message with additional information elements
In future versions of this protocol, non-critical information elements may be added to RRC messages. These additional information elements shall be normally appended at the end of the message; the transfer syntax specified in this revision of the standard facilitates this. A receiver conformant to this revision of the standard shall accept such extension, and proceed as if it was not included.
A transmitter conformant to this version of the standard shall not include an extension reserved for introducing non critical extensions in later versions of the standard; i.e. the corresponding parameter defined in the ASN.1 shall be absent.
NOTE:	If an extension, reserved for future non-critical extensions, is included (even if it is empty), this may result in transfer syntax errors when received by an implementation conforming to a later version of the standard.
Extensions to a release that are introduced after the subsequent release is frozen may however be inserted prior to the end of the message. To facilitate this, "variable length extension containers" have been introduced in most messages.
10.1.1.2	Critical extensions
10.1.1.2.1	Extension of an information element with additional values or choices
In versions of this protocol, choices, enumerated and size constrained types may be extended with critical values. For extension with critical values the general critical extension mechanism is used, i.e. for this no spare values are reserved since backward compatibility is not required.
10.1.1.2.2	Extension of a message with additional information elements
In future versions of this protocol, RRC messages may be extended with new information elements. Since messages including critical extensions are rejected by receivers not comprehending them, these messages may be modified completely, e.g. IEs may be inserted at any place and IEs may be removed or redefined.

NOTE 1:	The signalling supports the option that UTRAN maps one service to L1 combining slots for some neighbours and to the L2 combining slots for other neighbours ie. the use of different combining schemes for different neighbours
NOTE 2:	Transport combining can only be indicated when the complete L2 configuration is provided for the neighbouring cell (i.e. using L2 configuration choice “different”). Fortunately, a scenario in which the neighbouring cell configuration is different from the current cell is regarded as the typical scenario for using transport combining.
NOTE 3:	For FDD, an S-CCPCH power offset is defined as the offset between the transmitted power of the data part of one S-CCPCH and the transmitted power of the P-CPICH of a given cell (Ps-ccpch – Pp-cpich). For TDD, an S-CCPCH power offset is defined as the offset between one S-CCPCH and the P-CCPCH of a given cell (Ps-ccpch – Pp-ccpch).
NOTE 4:	The Secondary CCPCH Power Offset Difference IE gives the UE an indication of the S-CCPCH power on the neighbouring cells that may be used to complete the neighbouring cell ranking based on P-CPICH power for FDD or P-CCPCH for TDD.

Message
The IE is optionally present in the MEASUREMENT CONTROL and in the SRNS RELOCATION INFO messages, otherwise the IE is not needed.

NOTE 1:	The UTRAN may choose not to use the "Inter-RAT cell info indication" value "0" in the MEASUREMENT CONTROL message, to distinguish that case from those cases where the UE receives the IE "Inter-RAT cell info list" in SIB11 or SIB12.
NOTE 2:	In case of an SRNS relocation, if the UE has been sent the "Inter-RAT cell info indication" in the MEASUREMENT CONTROL message and the IE "Inter-RAT cell info list" is included in the SRNS RELOCATION INFO sent from the source RNC to the target RNC, the "Inter-RAT cell info indication" should be included in the IE "Inter-RAT cell info list".
NOTE 3:	If the UTRAN configures a UE with a "Inter-RAT cell info list" containing a set of GSM cells where one or more cell(s) belong to DCS 1800 band and one or more cell(s) belong to PCS 1900 band, the UE behaviour is unspecified.

This element provides the accuracy of the provided GPS time, or alternatively the accuracy of the provided relation between GPS and UTRAN time. If "GPS TOW" is the provided GPS time, or alternatively the GPS time corresponding to the UTRAN time provided, then the true GPS time lies in the interval ["GPS TOW"  "GPS Reference Time Uncertainty", "GPS TOW" + "GPS Reference Time Uncertainty"].
The uncertainty r, expressed in microseconds, is mapped to a number K with the following formula:
r = C*(((1+x)K)-1)

To encode any higher value of the uncertainty than that corresponding to K=127 in the formula above, or to indicate an undefined value of the "GPS TOW", the same value, K=127, shall be used.

11	Message and Information element abstract syntax (with ASN.1)
This clause contains definitions for RRC PDUs and IEs using a subset of ASN.1 as specified in [14]. PDU and IE definitions are grouped into separate ASN.1 modules.
11.0	General
Some messages and/or IEs may include one or more IEs with name "dummy" that are included only in the ASN.1. The UE should avoid sending information elements that are named "dummy" to UTRAN. Likewise, UTRAN should avoid sending IEs with name "dummy" to the UE. If the UE anyhow receives an information element named "dummy", it shall ignore the IE and process the rest of the message as if the IE was not included.
NOTE:	An IE with name "dummy" concerns an information element that was (erroneously) included in a previous version of the specification and has been removed by replacing it with a dummy with same type.
The UE shall only include the "variable length extension container" when it sends a non critical extension that according to this specification shall be transferred within this container.
If the abstract syntax of an IE is defined using the ASN.1 type "BIT STRING", and this IE corresponds to a functional IE definition in tabular format, in which the significance of bits is semantically defined, the following general rule shall be applied:
The bits in the ASN.1 bit string shall represent the semantics of the functional IE definition in decreasing order of bit significance;
-	with the first (or leftmost) bit in the bit string representing the most significant bit; and
-	with the last (or rightmost) bit in the bit string representing the least significant bit.

12	Message transfer syntax
Transfer syntax for RRC PDUs is derived from their ASN.1 definitions by use of Packed Encoding Rules, unaligned as specified in X.691 [49], and with adapted final padding. If special encoding is used, it is indicated in the ECN module defined for each ASN.1 module. The use of special encoding is defined in [14].
The following encoding rules apply in addition to what has been specified in X.691 [49]:
-	When a bit string value is placed in a bit-field as specified in 15.6 to 15.11 in [11], the leading bit of the bit string value shall be placed in the leading bit of the bit-field, and the trailing bit of the bit string value shall be placed in the trailing bit of the bit-field.
NOTE:	The terms "leading bit" and "trailing bit" are defined in ITU-T Rec. X.680 | ISO/IEC 8824-1. When using the "bstring" notation, the leading bit of the bit string value is on the left, and the trailing bit of the bit string value is on the right.
12.1	Structure of encoded RRC messages
An RRC PDU, which is the bit string that is exchanged between peer entities/ across the radio interface, is the concatenation of a basic production, an extension and padding, in that order.
RRC PDUs shall be mapped to and from RLC SDUs upon transmission and reception as follows:
-	when delivering an RRC PDU as an RLC SDU to the RLC layer for transmission, the first bit of the RRC PDU shall be represented as the first bit in the RLC SDU and onwards; and
-	upon reception of an RLC SDU from the RLC layer, the first bit of the RLC SDU shall represent the first bit of the RRC PDU and onwards.
12.1.1	Basic production
The 'basic production' is obtained by applying UNALIGNED PER to the abstract syntax value (the ASN.1 description) as specified in X.691, except for the 0 to 7 bits added at the end to produce a multiple of 8 bits. The basic production can have any positive number of bits, not necessarily a multiple of 8 bits.
12.1.2	Extension
Emitters compliant with this version of the specification of the protocol shall, unless indicated otherwise on a PDU type basis, set the extension part empty. Emitters compliant with a later version might send non-empty extensions.
12.1.3	Padding
Emitters compliant with this version of the specification of the protocol shall, unless indicated otherwise on a PDU type basis, pad the basic production with the smallest number of bits required to meet the size constraints of the lower layers. Padding bits shall be set to 0.
Receivers compliant with this version of the specification have no need to distinguish the extension and padding parts, and shall, unless indicated otherwise on a PDU type basis, accept RRC PDUs with any bit string in the extension and padding parts.

Figure 12.1.3-1: Padding
When using AM or UM mode, RLC requires that the RRC PDU length is a multiple of 8 bits.
When using Tr mode, RLC does neither impose size requirements nor perform padding. This implies that RRC has to take into account the transport format set defined for the transport channel across which the message is to be sent. RRC shall add the lowest number of padding bits required to fit the size specified for the selected transport format.
For system information blocks, building the PDU involves two steps. The first step is the building of the System Information Blocks, in which step padding is not applied (the rules for extension apply). The second step is the building of the RRC PDUs, involving segmentation and concatenation of System Information Blocks, and then padding as described above for Tr mode. The procedure is shown by means of an example as described in Figure 12.1.3-2. The example includes two System Information Blocks, SIBn and SIBn+1, of which only SIBn includes a protocol extension. The two System Information Blocks used in the example do not require segmentation and are concatenated into one SYSTEM INFORMATION message.

Figure 12.1.3-2: Padding for System Information
PCI: Protocol control information at SYSTEM INFORMATION message level
SI: SYSTEM INFORMATION message
For system information blocks, RRC may also add padding information at the end of IE "SIB data fixed", used both within IE "Last segment" and IE "Complete SIB". The IE "SIB data fixed" has a fixed length i.e. no length denominator used. In case the remaining amount of "SIB data" information is insufficient to fill the IE completely, RRC includes padding bits.
Since no length denominator is included, the receiving RRC cannot remove the padding added by the sender. However, since the padding used is the same as the padding added by the PER encoder to achieve octet alignment, the receiver can handle it.
NOTE 1	The mechanism described above implies that the PDU provided to the ASN.1 decoder may have more than 7 padding bits included. For a complete System Information Block of length 215 bits, 11 padding bits are added by RRC. Since the decoder requires an octet aligned input, 6 additional bits need to be added. In this (worst) case, a total of 17 padding bits is included.
NOTE 2	For the above cases, use of padding bits is possible and more efficient than including a length denominator.
When using the RRC padding described above, the segment has a fixed length, which completely fills the transport block. Therefore, in this case no RRC padding is added within the SYSTEM INFORMATION message. This is illustrated by means of the following figure.

13.5	UE RRC Procedure Performance
This subclause defines the performance requirements related to RRC procedures in the UE. Where the total delay is impacted by processing of variable length on the physical layer (e.g. physical layer synchronisation), references to appropriate specifications are given.
13.5.1	Definitions
The following definitions of N1 and N2 are valid only for this UE RRC Procedure Performance specification.
N1 = upper limit on the time required to execute modifications in UE after the reception of a UTRAN -> UE message has been completed. Where applicable (e.g. the physical layer transmission is impacted), the changes shall be adopted in the beginning of the next TTI starting after N1. N1 is specified as a multiple of 10 ms.
N2 = number of 10 ms radio frames from end of reception of UTRAN -> UE message on UE physical layer before the transmission of the UE -> UTRAN response message must be ready to start on a transport channel with no access delay other than the TTI alignment (e.g. DCH, therefore excluding delays caused by RACH procedure etc). The UE response message transmission from the physical layer shall begin at the latest (N2*10)+TTI ms after completion of the reception of the last TTI carrying the triggering UTRAN -> UE message. When Target State is CELL_DCH, the UE response message transmission from the physical layer may be additionally delayed by the value of IE "SRB delay".
N1 and N2 are independent (e.g. N2-N1 is not restricted to being less than or equal to 10ms).

13.6d	Parameters for BCCH mapped to BCH
The transport format parameters for BCH are specified in [34].
13.7	Parameter values for default radio configurations
The UE shall support the use of the default radio configurations that are specified in the following.
NOTE 1:	These configurations are based on [41] and cover a number of RAB and signalling connection configurations.
In the table that is used to specify the parameter values for these default configurations, the following principles are used:
-	Optional IEs that are not used are omitted;
-	In case no parameter value is specified in a column, this means the value given the previous (left side) column applies.
NOTE 2:	If needed, signalling radio bearer RB4 is established after the completion of handover.
NOTE 3:	For each default configuration, the value of FDD, 3.84 Mcps TDD, 7.68 Mcps TDD and 1.28 Mcps TDD parameters are specified. All parameters apply to FDD, 3.84 Mcps TDD, 7.68 Mcps and 1.28 Mcps TDD modes, unless explicitly stated otherwise. It should be noted that in this respect default configurations differ from pre-defined configurations, which only include parameter values for one mode.
NOTE 4:	The transport format sizes, indicated in the following table, concern the RLC PDU size, since all configurations concern dedicated channels. The transport block sizes indicated in TS 34.108 are different since these include the size of the MAC header.
NOTE 5:	The tabular values included in this subclause, represent the actual IE values as in clause 10, and not the ASN.1 representation of these values.

NOTE:	the difference between default configuration #22 and default configuration #1 (13.6 kbps signalling) resides in the RLC configuration and the DCH quality target.

14	Specific functions
14.1	Intra-frequency measurements
14.1.1	Intra-frequency measurement quantities
A measurement quantity is used to evaluate whether an intra-frequency event has occurred or not. It can be:
1	Downlink Ec/N0.
2	Downlink path loss.
For FDD:
Pathloss in dB = Primary CPICH Tx power - CPICH RSCP.
For Primary CPICH Tx power the IE "Primary CPICH Tx power" shall be used. The unit is dBm.
CPICH RSCP is the result of the CPICH RSCP measurement. The unit is dBm.
For TDD:
Pathloss in dB = Primary CCPCH TX power - Primary CCPCH RSCP.
For Primary CCPCH TX power the IE "Primary CCPCH TX Power" shall be used. The unit is dBm.
Primary CCPCH RSCP is the result of the Primary CCPCH RSCP measurement. The unit is dBm.
If necessary Pathloss shall be rounded up to the next higher integer.
Results higher than 158 shall be reported as 158.
Results lower than 46 shall be reported as 46.
3	Downlink received signal code power (RSCP) after despreading.
4	ISCP measured on Timeslot basis.
A description of those values can be found in [7] and [8].
14.1.2	Intra-frequency reporting events for FDD
Within the measurement reporting criteria field in the Measurement Control message the UTRAN notifies the UE which events should trigger a measurement report. The listed events are the toolbox from which the UTRAN can choose the reporting events that are needed for the implemented handover evaluation function, or other radio network functions.
All the specified events are measured with respect to any of the measurement quantities given in subclause 14.1.1. The measurement quantities are measured on the monitored primary common pilot channels (CPICH) of the cell defined in the measurement object.
Special mechanisms for the events are illustrated in subclause 14.1.4 and 14.1.5.
NOTE:	The events below are numbered 1A, 1B, 1C,… since all intra-frequency reporting events would be labelled 1X, inter-frequency reporting events would be labelled 2X, and so on for the other measurement types.
When one intra-frequency measurement identity corresponds to multiple intra-frequency events with identical event identities, the UE behaviour is not specified.
14.1.2.1	Reporting event 1A: A Primary CPICH enters the reporting range
When an intra-frequency measurement configuring event 1a is set up, the UE shall:
1>	create a variable TRIGGERED_1A_EVENT related to that measurement, which shall initially be empty;
1>	delete this variable when the measurement is released.
When event 1A is configured in the UE, the UE shall:
1>	if "Measurement quantity" is "pathloss" and Equation 1 below is fulfilled for one or more primary CPICHs, or if "Measurement quantity" is "CPICH Ec/N0" or "CPICH RSCP", and Equation 2 below is fulfilled for one or more primary CPICHs, for each of these primary CPICHs:
2>	if all required reporting quantities are available for that cell; and
2>	if the equations have been fulfilled for a time period indicated by "Time to trigger", and if that primary CPICH is part of cells allowed to trigger the event according to "Triggering condition 2", and if that primary CPICH is not included in the "cells triggered" in the variable TRIGGERED_1A_EVENT:
3>	include that primary CPICH in the "cells recently triggered" in the variable TRIGGERED_1A_EVENT.
1>	if the value of "Reporting deactivations threshold" for this event is greater than or equal to the current number of cells in the active set or equal to 0 and any primary CPICHs are stored in the "cells recently triggered" in the variable TRIGGERED_1A_EVENT:
2>	if "Reporting interval" for this event is not equal to 0:
3>	if the IE "Periodical reporting running" in the variable TRIGGERED_1A_EVENT is set to FALSE:
4>	start a timer with the value of "Reporting interval" for this event and set the IE "Periodical reporting running" in the variable TRIGGERED_1A_EVENT to TRUE;
3>	set "sent reports" for the primary CPICHs in "cells recently triggered" in the variable TRIGGERED_1A_EVENT to 1.
2>	send a measurement report with IEs set as below:
3>	set in "intra-frequency measurement event results": "Intrafrequency event identity" to "1a"; and
3>	include in "cell measurement event results" all entries of the "cells recently triggered" in the variable TRIGGERED_1A_EVENT in descending order according to the configured measurement quantity taking into account the cell individual offset for each of those cells;
3>	set the IE "measured results" and the IE "additional measured results" according to subclause 8.4.2, not taking into account the cell individual offset for each cell.
2>	move all entries from "cells recently triggered" to "cells triggered" in the variable TRIGGERED_1A_EVENT.
1>	if the timer for the periodical reporting has expired:
2>	if any primary CPICH is included in the "cells triggered" in the variable TRIGGERED_1A_EVENT:
3>	if "Reporting interval" for this event is not equal to 0, and if "Amount of reporting" is greater than "sent reports" stored for any of these primary CPICHs, in "cells triggered" in the variable TRIGGERED_1A_EVENT:
4>	increment the stored counter "sent reports" for all CPICHs in "cell triggered" in variable TRIGGERED_1A_EVENT;
4>	start a timer with the value of "Reporting interval" for this event;
4>	send a measurement report with IEs set as below:
5>	set in "intra-frequency measurement event results": "Intrafrequency event identity" to "1a"; and
5>	include in "cell measurement event results" all entries of the variable TRIGGERED_1A_EVENT with value of IE "sent reports" equal to or smaller than value of "Amount of reporting" in descending order according to the configured measurement quantity taking into account the cell individual offset for each of those cells;
5>	set the IE "measured results" and the IE "additional measured results" according to subclause 8.4.2, not taking into account the cell individual offset for each cell.
4>	if "sent reports" in variable TRIGGERED_1A_EVENT is equal to "Amount of reporting" for all entries:
5>	set the IE "Periodical Reporting running" in the variable TRIGGERED_1A_EVENT to FALSE and disable the timer for the periodical reporting.
1>	if "Measurement quantity" is "pathloss" and Equation 3 below is fulfilled for a primary CPICH, or if "Measurement quantity" is "CPICH Ec/N0" or "CPICH RSCP", and Equation 4 below is fulfilled for a primary CPICH; or
1>	if a primary CPICH is no longer part of the cells allowed to trigger the event according to the "Triggering condition 2":
2>	if that primary CPICH is included in the "cells triggered" or "cells recently triggered" in the variable TRIGGERED_1A_EVENT:
3>	remove the entry of that primary CPICH from "cells triggered" or "cells recently triggered" in the variable TRIGGERED_1A_EVENT.
3>	if no entry in the variable TRIGGERED_1A_EVENT has a value of "sent reports" smaller than "Amount of reporting"; or
3>	if there is no entry in the variable TRIGGERED_1A_EVENT:
4>	if the reporting interval timer is running:
5>	stop the reporting interval timer;
5>	set the IE "Periodical reporting running" in the variable TRIGGERED_1A_EVENT to FALSE.
This event is only applicable to the CELL_DCH state. When the measurement is setup in CELL_DCH or upon transition to CELL_DCH the UE shall:
1>	if the "Triggering condition 2" includes active set cells:
2>	include the primary CPICH of all cells in the current active set into the "cells triggered" in the variable TRIGGERED_1A_EVENT with the counter "sent reports" set to "Amount of reporting".
Equation 1 (Triggering condition for pathloss)

Equation 2 (Triggering condition for all the other measurement quantities)

Equation 3 (Leaving triggering condition for pathloss)

Equation 4 (Leaving triggering condition for all the other measurement quantities)

The variables in the formula are defined as follows:
MNew is the measurement result of the cell entering the reporting range.
CIONew is the individual cell offset for the cell entering the reporting range if an individual cell offset is stored for that cell. Otherwise it is equal to 0.
Mi is a measurement result of a cell not forbidden to affect reporting range in the active set.
NA is the number of cells not forbidden to affect reporting range in the current active set.
For pathloss
MBest is the measurement result of the cell not forbidden to affect reporting range in the active set with the lowest measurement result, not taking into account any cell individual offset.
for other measurements quantities.
MBest is the measurement result of the cell not forbidden to affect reporting range in the active set with the highest measurement result, not taking into account any cell individual offset.
W is a parameter sent from UTRAN to UE.
R1a is the reporting range constant.
H1a is the hysteresis parameter for the event 1a.
If the measurement results are pathloss or CPICH-Ec/No then MNew, Mi and MBest are expressed as ratios.
If the measurement result is CPICH-RSCP then MNew, Mi and MBest are expressed in mW.
14.1.2.2	Reporting event 1B: A primary CPICH leaves the reporting range
When an intra-frequency measurement configuring event 1b is set up, the UE shall:
1>	create a variable TRIGGERED_1B_EVENT related to that measurement, which shall initially be empty;
1>	delete this variable when the measurement is released.
When event 1B is configures in the UE, the UE shall:
1>	if "Measurement quantity" is "pathloss" and Equation 1 below is fulfilled for one or more primary CPICHs, or if "Measurement quantity" is "CPICH Ec/N0" or "CPICH RSCP", and Equation 2 below is fulfilled for one or more primary CPICHs, for each of these primary CPICHs:
2>	if all required reporting quantities are available for that cell, and if the equations have been fulfilled for a time period indicated by "Time to trigger", and if that primary CPICH is part of cells allowed to trigger the event according to "Triggering condition 1", and if that primary CPICH is not included in the "cells triggered" in the variable TRIGGERED_1B_EVENT:
3>	include that primary CPICH in the "cells recently triggered" in the variable TRIGGERED_1B_EVENT.
1>	if any primary CPICHs are stored in the "cells recently triggered" in the variable TRIGGERED_1B_EVENT:
2>	if "Periodic reporting info-1b" is present, and "Reporting interval" for this event is not equal to 0:
3>	if the IE "Periodical reporting running" in the variable TRIGGERED_1B_EVENT is set to FALSE:
4>	start a timer with the value of "Reporting interval" for this event and set the IE "Periodical reporting running" in the variable TRIGGERED_1B_EVENT to TRUE;
3>	set "sent reports" for the primary CPICHs in "cells recently triggered" in the variable TRIGGERED_1B_EVENT to 1.
2>	send a measurement report with IEs set as below:
3>	set in "intra-frequency measurement event results": "Intrafrequency event identity" to "1b"; and
3>	include in "cell measurement event results" all entries of "cells recently triggered" in the variable TRIGGERED_1B_EVENT in ascending order according to the configured measurement quantity taking into account the cell individual offset for each of those cells;
3>	set the IE "measured results" and the IE "additional measured results" according to subclause 8.4.2, not taking into account the cell individual offset for each cell.
2>	move all entries from IE "cells recently triggered" to "cells triggered" in the variable TRIGGERED_1B_EVENT.
1>	if the timer for the periodical reporting has expired:
2>	if any primary CPICH is included in the "cells triggered" in the variable TRIGGERED_1B_EVENT:
3> if "Periodic reporting info-1b" is present:
4>	if "Reporting interval" is not equal to 0, and if "Amount of reporting" is greater than "sent reports" stored for any of these primary CPICHs, in "cells triggered" in the variable TRIGGERED_1B_EVENT:
5>	increment the stored counter "sent reports" for all CPICHs in "cell triggered" in variable TRIGGERED_1B_EVENT;
5>	start a timer with the value of "Reporting interval-1b" for this event;
5>	send a measurement report with IEs set as below:
6>	set in "intra-frequency measurement event results": "Intrafrequency event identity" to "1b"; and
6>	include in "cell measurement event results" all entries of the variable TRIGGERED_1B_EVENT with value of IE "sent reports" equal to or smaller than value of "Amount of reporting" in ascending order according to the configured measurement quantity taking into account the cell individual offset for each of those cells;
6>	set the IE "measured results" and the IE "additional measured results" according to subclause 8.4.2, not taking into account the cell individual offset for each cell.

14.1.4	Event-triggered periodic intra-frequency measurement reports (informative)
14.1.4.1	Cell addition failure (FDD only)

Figure 14.1.4.1-1: Periodic reporting triggered by event 1A
When a cell enters the reporting range and triggers event 1A, the UE shall transmit a MEASUREMENT REPORT to the UTRAN and typically this may result in an update of the active set. However, in some situations the UTRAN may be unable to add a strong cell to the active set typically due to capacity shortage for example.
The UE shall continue reporting after the initial report by reverting to periodical measurement reporting if the reported cell is not added to the active set. This is illustrated in Figure 14.1.4.1-1. During periodic reporting the UE shall transmit MEASUREMENT REPORT messages to the UTRAN at predefined intervals. The reports shall include reporting information of the cells in the current active set and of the monitored cell(s) in the reporting range.
Event-triggered periodic measurement reporting shall be terminated if:
1>	there are no longer any monitored cell(s) within the reporting range; or
1>	the UTRAN has added cells to the active set so that it includes the maximum number of cells (defined by the reporting deactivation threshold parameter), which are allowed for event 1A to be triggered; or
1>	the UE has sent the maximum number of MEASUREMENT REPORT messages (defined by the amount of reporting parameter).
The reporting period is assigned by the UTRAN (with the Reporting interval parameter). If the reporting interval is set to zero event-triggered periodic measurement reporting shall not be applied.
14.1.4.1a	Cell removal failure (FDD only)

Figure 14.1.4.1a: Periodic reporting triggered by event 1B
When a cell enters the removal range and triggers event 1B, the UE shall transmit a MEASUREMENT REPORT to the UTRAN and typically this may result in the removal of the weakest active cell. If the UTRAN is unable to receive MEASUREMENT REPORT after the maximum retransmission, it is beneficial to receive continuous reports in this case as well.
The UE shall revert to periodical measurement reporting if the UTRAN does not update the active set after the transmission of the measurement report. This is illustrated in Figure 14.1.4.1a. During periodic reporting the UE shall transmit MEASUREMENT REPORT messages to the UTRAN at predefined intervals.
Event-triggered periodic measurement reporting shall be terminated if:
1>	there are no longer any monitored cell(s) within the removal range; or
1>	the UTRAN has removed cells from the active set so that there are no longer the minimum amount of active cells for event 1B to be triggered; or
1>	the UE has sent the maximum number of MEASUREMENT REPORT messages (defined by the "amount of reporting" parameter).
The reporting period is assigned by the UTRAN (with the "Reporting interval" parameter). If the reporting interval is set to zero, event-triggered periodic measurement reporting shall not be applied.
14.1.4.2	Cell replacement failure (FDD only)

Figure 14.1.4.1-2: Periodic reporting triggered by event 1C
When a cell enters the replacement range and triggers event 1C, the UE shall transmit a MEASUREMENT REPORT to the UTRAN and typically this may result in the replacement of the weakest active cell. If the UTRAN is unable to replace the cell due to for example capacity shortage, it is beneficial to receive continuous reports in this case as well.
The UE shall revert to periodical measurement reporting if the UTRAN does not update the active set after the transmission of the measurement report. This is illustrated in Figure 14.1.4.1-2. During periodic reporting the UE shall transmit MEASUREMENT REPORT messages to the UTRAN at predefined intervals. The reports shall include reporting information of the cells in the current active set and of the monitored cell(s) in the replacement range.
Event-triggered periodic measurement reporting shall be terminated if:
1>	there are no longer any monitored cell(s) within the replacement range; or
1>	the UTRAN has removed cells from the active set so that there are no longer the minimum amount of active cells for event 1C to be triggered (as defined by the replacement activation threshold parameter); or
1>	the UE has sent the maximum number of MEASUREMENT REPORT messages (defined by the amount of reporting parameter).
The reporting period is assigned by the UTRAN (with the Reporting interval parameter). If the reporting interval is set to zero, event-triggered periodic measurement reporting shall not be applied.
14.1.5	Mechanisms available for modifying intra-frequency measurement reporting behaviour (informative)
14.1.5.1	Hysteresis
To limit the amount of event-triggered reports, a hysteresis parameter may be connected with each reporting event given above. The value of the hysteresis is given to the UE in the Reporting criteria field of the Measurement Control message.
In the example in Figure 14.1.5.1-1, the hysteresis ensures that the event 1D (FDD) or IG(TDD) (primary CPICH(FDD)/CCPCH(TDD) 2 becomes the best cell) is not reported until the difference is equal to the hysteresis value. The fact that primary CPICH(FDD)/CCPCH(TDD) 1 becomes best afterwards is not reported at all in the example since the primary CPICH(FDD)/CCPCH(TDD) 1 does not become sufficiently better than the primary CPICH(FDD)/CCPCH(TDD) 2.

Figure 14.1.5.1-1: Hysteresis limits the amount of measurement reports
14.1.5.2	Time-to-trigger
To limit the measurement signalling load, a time-to-trigger parameter could be connected with each reporting event given above. The value of the time-to-trigger is given to the UE in the Reporting criteria field of the Measurement Control message.
The effect of the time-to-trigger is that the report is triggered only after the conditions for the event have existed for the specified time-to-trigger. In the following FDD example in Figure 14.1.5.2-1, the use of time-to-trigger means that the event (primary CPICH 3 enters the reporting range) is not reported until is has been within the range for the time given by the time-to-trigger parameter.

Figure 14.1.5.2-1: Time-to-trigger limits the amount of measurement reports
In the following TDD example in Figure 14.1.5.2-2, the use of time-to-trigger means that the event (Timeslot ISCP upon certain threshold) is not reported until it has been upon the threshold for the time given by the time-to trigger parameter.

Figure 14.1.5.2-2: Time-to-trigger limits the amount of measurement reports
NOTE:	The time-to-trigger could be combined with hysteresis, i.e. a hysteresis value is added to the measurement quantity before evaluating if the time-to-trigger timer should be started.
14.1.5.3	Cell individual offsets
For each cell that is monitored, an offset can be assigned with inband signalling. The offset can be either positive or negative. The offset is added to the measurement quantity before the UE evaluates if an event has occurred. The UE receives the cell individual offsets for each primary CPICH(FDD)/CCPCH(TDD) in the IE "Cell individual offset" included in the IE "Cell info" associated with each measurement object included in the MEASUREMENT CONTROL message.
For the FDD example, in Figure 14.1.5.3-1, since an offset is added to primary CPICH 3, it is the dotted curve that is used to evaluate if an event occurs. Hence, this means that measurement reports from UE to UTRAN are triggered when primary CPICH plus the corresponding offset, i.e. the dotted curve, leaves and enters the reporting range and when it gets better than primary CPICH 1 (if these events have been ordered by UTRAN). This offset mechanism provides the network with an efficient tool to change the reporting of an individual primary CPICH.
By applying a positive offset, as in Figure 14.1.5.3-1, the UE will send measurement reports as if the primary CPICH is offset x dB better than what it really is. This could be useful if the operator knows that a specific cell is interesting to monitor more carefully, even though it is not so good for the moment. In the example in Figure 14.1.5.3-1, the operator might know by experience that in this area primary CPICH 3 can become good very quickly (e.g. due to street corners) and therefore that it is worth reporting more intensively. Depending on the implemented handover evaluation algorithm, this may result in the cell with primary CPICH 3 being included in the active set earlier than would have been the case without the positive offset.

Figure 14.1.5.3-1: A positive offset is applied to primary CPICH 3 before event evaluation in the UE
For the TDD example, in Figure 14.1.5.3-2, an offset is added to primary CCPCH2, it is the dotted curve that is used to evaluate if the primary CCPCH2 becomes better than primary CCPCH1 (ordered by the UTRAN).

Figure 14.1.5.3-2: A positive offset is applied to primary CCPCH 2
Correspondingly, the operator can choose to apply a negative offset to a primary CCPCH. Then the reporting on that primary CCPCH is limited and the corresponding cell may be, at least temporarily excluded from the active set or as a target cell for handover.
It is important to note that the offset is added before triggering events, i.e. the offset is added by the UE before evaluating if a measurement report should be sent as opposed to offsets that are applied in the network and used for the actual handover evaluation. It should also be noted that the cell individual offset is not used in all measurement reporting events, and that it is not applied to all events in the same way.
14.1.5.4	Forbid a Primary CPICH to affect the reporting range (FDD only)
The reporting range affects the reporting events 1A and 1B presented above. The reporting range is defined as a function of all the Primary CPICHs in the active set (see 14.1.2.1 and 14.1.2.2). If the parameter W is set to 0, the reporting range is defined relative to the best Primary CPICH. However, there could be cases where it is good to forbid a specific Primary CPICH to affect the reporting range. For example in Figure 14.1.5.4-1 the network has requested the UE to not let Primary CPICH 3 affect the reporting range. This mechanism could be effective if the operator knows by experience that the quality of Primary CPICH 3 is very unstable in a specific area and therefore should not affect the reporting of the other Primary CPICHs.
The UE shall ignore that a Primary CPICH is forbidden to affect the reporting range if all of the following conditions are fulfilled:
-	the Primary CPICH is included in active set; and
-	all cells in active set are defined as Primary CPICHs forbidden to affect the reporting range.

Figure 14.1.5.4-1: Primary CPICH 3 is forbidden to affect the reporting range
14.1.6	Report quantities in intra-frequency measurements

14.2.1	Inter-frequency reporting events
Within the measurement reporting criteria field in the MEASUREMENT CONTROL message UTRAN notifies the UE which events should trigger the UE to send a MEASUREMENT REPORT message. The listed events are the toolbox from which the UTRAN can choose the reporting events that are needed for the implemented handover evaluation function, or other radio network functions.
All events are evaluated with respect to one of the measurement quantities given in subclause 14.2.0a. The measurement quantities are measured on the monitored primary common pilot channels (CPICH) in FDD mode and the monitored primary common control channels (PCCPCH) in TDD mode of the cell defined in the measurement object. A "non-used frequency" is a frequency that the UE has been ordered to measure upon but is not used for the connection. A "used frequency" is a frequency that the UE has been ordered to measure upon and is also currently used for the connection.
The "monitored set on non-used frequency" consists of cells in "cells for measurement" (or all cells in CELL_INFO_LIST if "cells for measurement" is not present) that are not part of the virtual active set on that non-used frequency.
When one inter-frequency measurement identity corresponds to multiple inter-frequency events with identical event identities, the UE behaviour is not specified.

4> include in IE "Inter-frequency measured results list" the measured results for the non-used frequency that triggered the event, not taking into account the cell individual offset.

A description of those values can be found in [7] and [8].
14.3.1	Inter-RAT reporting events
Within the measurement reporting criteria field in the MEASUREMENT CONTROL message the UTRAN notifies the UE which events should trigger the UE to send a MEASUREMENT REPORT message. The listed events are the toolbox from which the UTRAN can choose the reporting events that are needed for the implemented handover evaluation function, or other radio network functions.
All events are measured with respect to one of the measurement quantities given in subclause 14.3.0a, and of the frequency quality estimate given in subclause 14.3.0b. For UTRAN the measurement quantities are measured on the monitored primary common pilot channels (CPICH) in FDD mode and the monitored primary common control channels (PCCPCH) in TDD mode of the cell defined in the measurement object. For other RATs the measurement quantities are system-specific. A "used UTRAN frequency" is a frequency that the UE have been ordered to measure upon and is also currently used for the connection to UTRAN. "Other system" is e.g. GSM.
In the text below describing the events:

14.4.2.1	Reporting event 4 A: Transport Channel Traffic Volume becomes larger than an absolute threshold

Figure 14.4.2.1-1: Event triggered report when Transport Channel Traffic Volume becomes larger than a certain threshold
If the monitored Transport Channel Traffic Volume (TCTV) [15] is larger than an absolute threshold at TVM setup or modify, or is larger at activation of the monitored transport channel, or becomes larger than an absolute threshold while the event is configured i.e. if TCTV>Reporting threshold, this event could trigger a report. The event could be triggered again only if TCTV becomes smaller than the Reporting threshold and later TCTV>Reporting threshold is verified again.
14.4.2.2	Reporting event 4 B: Transport Channel Traffic Volume becomes smaller than an absolute threshold

Figure 14.4.2.1-2: Event triggered report when Transport Channel Traffic Volume becomes smaller than certain threshold
If the monitored Transport Channel Traffic Volume (TCTV) [15] is smaller than an absolute threshold at TVM setup or modify, or is smaller at activation of the monitored transport channel, or becomes smaller than an absolute threshold while the event is configured i.e. if TCTV<Reporting threshold, this event could trigger a report. The event could be triggered again only if TCTV becomes bigger than the Reporting threshold and later TCTV<Reporting threshold is verified again.
14.4.3	Traffic volume reporting mechanisms
Traffic volume measurement triggering could be associated with both a time-to-trigger and a pending time after trigger. The time-to-trigger is used to get time domain hysteresis, i.e. the condition must be fulfilled during the time-to-trigger time before a report is sent. Pending time after trigger is used to limit consecutive reports when one traffic volume measurement report already has been sent and enables periodic reporting while the TCTV remains above(4a) or below(4b) the threshold. This is described in detail below.
14.4.3.1	Pending time after trigger
This timer is started in the UE when a measurement report has been triggered by a given event. The UE is then forbidden to send new measurement reports triggered by the same event during this time period. Instead the UE waits until the timer has expired. If the Transport Channel Traffic Volume [15] is still above the threshold for event 4a, or below the threshold for event 4b when the timer expires, the UE sends a new measurement report, and the timer is restarted. Otherwise it waits for a new triggering.

Figure 14.4.3.1-1: Pending time after trigger limits the amount of consecutive measurement reports
Figure 14.4.3.1-1 shows that by increasing the pending time after trigger a triggered second event does not result in a measurement report. The figure assumes absence of the IE "Time to trigger".
14.4.3.2	Time-to-trigger
The timer is started in the UE when the Transport Channel Traffic Volume triggers the event. If the TCTV crosses the threshold before the timer expires, the timer is stopped. If the timer expires then a report is triggered.

Figure 14.4.3.1-2: Time-to-trigger is used to achieve time hysteresis
Figure 14.4.3.1-2 shows that by increasing the time-to-trigger the report is not triggered.
14.4.4	Interruption of user data transmission
By including the IE "Tx Interruption after trigger", a UE in CELL_FACH state may be instructed by the UTRAN to prohibit transmission of user data on the RACH temporarily after a measurement report has been triggered.
The UE shall only resume transmission of user data, when:
1>	it receives from the UTRAN a message allocating a dedicated physical channel, leading to the transition to CELL_DCH state; or
1>	the time period indicated by the IE "Tx Interruption after trigger" elapses.
The transmission on signalling radio bearers shall not be interrupted.
14.5	Quality Measurements
14.5.1	Quality reporting measurement quantities
For quality measurements, the following measurement quantities are used:
1.	Downlink transport channel BLER
2.	Timeslot SIR (TDD only)
14.5.2	Quality reporting events
When one measurement identity corresponds to multiple quality events for the same transport channel, the UE behaviour is not specified.
14.5.2.1	Reporting event 5A: A predefined number of bad CRCs is exceeded
When this event is ordered by UTRAN in a measurement control message, the UE shall send a measurement report when the amount of bad CRCs during a predefined sliding window exceeds a predefined number.
The following three parameters are used in the scheme:
-	Total CRC = the length of the sliding window over which the number of bad CRCs are counted.
-	Bad CRC = the number of bad CRC that is required within the latest "Total CRC" received CRCs for the event to be triggered.
-	Pending after trigger = a new event can not be triggered until "Pending after trigger" CRCs have been received,
When a DCH is established, the UE shall begin to count the number of bad CRCs within the last "Total CRC" received CRCs. No event can be triggered until at least "Total CRC" CRCs have been received. For each new received CRC, the UE shall compare the number of bad CRCs within the latest "Total CRC" received CRCs with the parameter "Bad CRC". An event shall be triggered if the number of bad CRCs is equal or larger than "Bad CRC".
At the time when the event is triggered a pending time after trigger timer is started with the length of "Pending after trigger" CRCs. A new event can not be triggered until Pending after trigger" CRCs have been received. When Pending after trigger" CRCs have been received the event evaluation start again and a new event can be triggered.

3.	UE Rx-Tx time difference (FDD only).

14.9	Downlink power control
14.9.1	Generalities
This function is implemented in the UE in order to set the SIR target value on each CCTrCH used for the downlink power control. This SIR value shall be adjusted according to an autonomous function in the UE in order to achieve the same measured quality as the quality target set by UTRAN. The quality target is set as the transport channel BLER value for each transport channel as signalled by UTRAN.
When transport channel BLER is used the UE shall run a quality target control loop such that the quality requirement is met for each transport channel, which has been assigned a BLER target.
The UE shall set the SIR target when the physical channel has been set up or reconfigured. It shall not increase the SIR target value before the power control has converged on the current value. The UE may estimate whether the power control has converged on the current value, by comparing the averaged measured SIR to the SIR target value.
NOTE:	The power control function for F-DPCH is specified in [29].
14.9.2	Downlink power control in compressed mode
In compressed mode, the target SIR needs to be changed in several frames compared to normal mode. For this purpose, four values DeltaSIR1, DeltaSIRafter1, DeltaSIR2 and DeltaSIRafter2 are signalled by the UTRAN to the UE (see subclause 10.2.9).
For each frame, the target SIR offset during compressed mode, compared to normal mode is:
	SIR = max (SIR1_compression, … , SIRn_compression) + SIR1_coding + SIR2_coding
where n is the number of TTI lengths for all TrChs of the CCTrCh, Fi is the length in number of frames of the i-th TTI and where SIR_coding fulfils:
-	SIR1_coding= DeltaSIR1 if the start of the first transmission gap in the transmission gap pattern is within the current frame.
-	SIR1_coding= DeltaSIRafter1 if the current frame just follows a frame containing the start of the first transmission gap in the transmission gap pattern.
-	SIR2_coding= DeltaSIR2 if the start of the second transmission gap in the transmission gap pattern is within the current frame.
-	SIR2_coding= DeltaSIRafter2 if the current frame just follows a frame containing the start of the second transmission gap in the transmission gap pattern.
-	SIR1_coding= 0 and SIR2_coding= 0 otherwise.
and SIRi_compression is defined by :
-	SIRi_compression = 3 dB for downlink frames compressed by reducing the spreading factor by 2.
-	SIRi_compression = 0 dB in all other cases.
Several compressed mode patterns applying to the same frames should be avoided as much as possible.
In case several compressed mode patterns are used simultaneously, a SIR offset is computed for each compressed mode pattern and the sum of all SIR offsets is applied to the frame.
14.10	Calculated Transport Format Combination
The Calculated Transport Format Combination (CTFC) is a tool for efficient signalling of transport format combinations.
Let I be the number of transport channels that are included in the transport format combination. For DCHs, all configured DCHs are included in the transport format combination. Each transport channel TrCHi, i = 1, 2, …, I, has Li transport formats, i.e. the transport format indicator TFIi can take Li values, .
Define , where i = 1, 2, …, I, and L0 = 1.
Let TFC(TFI1, TFI2, …, TFII) be the transport format combination for which TrCH1 has transport format TFI1, TrCH2 has transport format TFI2, etc. The corresponding CTFC(TFI1, TFI2, …, TFII) is then computed as:
.
For FACH and PCH transport channels, "TrCH1" corresponds to the transport channel listed at the first position in IE "FACH/PCH information" in IE "Secondary CCPCH System Information", "TrCH2" corresponds to the transport channel listed at the second position in IE "FACH/PCH information" and so on.
For all other transport channels in FDD and for all configured transport channels of the same transport channel type (i.e. DCH, DSCH, USCH) in TDD, "TrCH1" corresponds to the transport channel having the lowest transport channel identity in the transport format combination mapped to the TFCI field. "TrCH2" corresponds to the transport channel having the next lowest transport channel identity, and so on.
14.10.1	Default TFCS for MBMS
14.10.1.1	S-CCPCH configuration including a FACH carrying MSCH
In case the S-CCPCH configuration includes a FACH carrying MSCH, the default TFCS is defined according to the following:
Let TrCH 1 be the FACH carrying MSCH, TrCH 2 be the first TrCH carrying MTCH listed in the IE "TrCh information list", TrCH 3 be the second TrCH carrying MTCH listed in the IE "TrCh information list" etc. and let TrCH I be the last TrCH carrying MTCH listed in the IE "TrCh information list".
Each transport channel TrCHi, i = 1, 2, …, I, has Li transport formats, i.e. the transport format indicator TFIi can take Li values.
Each transport format combination set is defined by the transport formats of each transport channel mapped on this S-CCPCH: 
TFC = (TFI1, TFI2, …, TFII).
The "MBMS implicit TFCS" contains then the following set of TFCs:
TFCS = {(0,0,…,0),(0,1,…,0),…,(0,L2,…,0),(0,0,1,…,0),…,(0,0,L3,…,0),…,(0,0,0,…,1),…,(0,0,0,…,LI),

(2,0,…,0),…,(L1,0,…,0)}
14.10.1.2	S-CCPCH configuration not including a FACH carrying MSCH
In case the S-CCPCH configuration does not include a FACH carrying MSCH, the default TFCS is defined according to the following:
Let TrCH 1 be the first TrCH listed in the IE "TrCh information list", TrCH 2 be the second TrCH listed in the IE "TrCh information list" etc. and let TrCH I be the last TrCH listed in the IE "TrCh information list".
Each transport channel TrCHi, i = 1, 2, …, I, has Li transport formats, i.e. the transport format indicator TFIi can take Li values.
Each transport format combination set is defined by the transport formats of each transport channel mapped on this S-CCPCH: 
TFC = (TFI1, TFI2, …, TFII).

14.11	UE autonomous update of virtual active set on non-used frequency (FDD only)
In the text that follows:
-	a "non-used frequency" is a frequency that the UE has been ordered to measure upon but is not used for the connection. A "used frequency" is a frequency that the UE has been ordered to measure upon and is also currently used for the connection;
-	a "non-used frequency (resp. cell) considered in an inter-frequency measurement" shall be understood as a non-used frequency (resp. cell) included in the list of cells pointed at in the IE "cells for measurement" if it was received for that measurement, or otherwise as a non-used frequency (resp. cell) included in the "Inter-frequency cell info" part of the variable CELL_INFO_LIST.
For event-triggered inter frequency measurements it is possible to use intra-frequency measurement reporting events for support of maintenance of an active set associated with a non-used frequency considered in that measurement, a "virtual active set" and used in the evaluation of the frequency quality estimates. The "initial virtual active set" for a frequency is the virtual active set that is associated to that frequency just after a message was received that sets up or modifies the inter-frequency measurement.
The way the virtual active sets are initiated and updated for the non-used frequencies considered in an inter-frequency measurement is described in the two subclauses below.
The UE shall support a single virtual active set per non-used frequency.
The virtual active set is not initialised and maintained for an inter frequency measurement with periodic reporting. A virtual active set initialised and maintained by another inter-frequency measurement does not affect reporting of the periodic inter-frequency measurement.
14.11.1	Initial virtual active set
If the UE receives a MEASUREMENT CONTROL message that sets up or modifies an inter-frequency measurement and includes the IE "Inter-frequency set update"; or
If at least one cell can be measured on a non-used frequency for which the current virtual active set is empty (see subclause 14.11.2), the UE shall:
1>	for each non-used frequency Fi considered in the measurement where cells can be measured:
2>	if event 1a is configured for the used frequency in an intra-frequency measurement:
3>	include in the initial virtual active set the Ni cells that have either the greatest downlink Ec/N0 or the greatest downlink RSCP after despreading or the lowest pathloss (the measurement quantity to be used is determined by the IE "intra-frequency measurement quantity" of the intra-frequency measurement from which the event 1a configuration is taken), among the cells on frequency Fi considered in that inter-frequency measurement, where:
	 if N1a0 and  otherwise.
	where:
	N1a is the "Reporting deactivation threshold" included in the intra-frequency measurement for the first event 1a defined in the intra-frequency measurement with the lowest identity at the time the inter-frequency measurement was received with the IE "Inter-frequency set update" present.
	NCells Fi is the number of cells on frequency Fi considered in that inter-frequency measurement.
2>	else:
	
	where:
	NCells Fi is the number of cells on frequency Fi considered in that inter-frequency measurement.
NOTE1:	The UE initialises the virtual active set with up to the maximum number of inter-frequency cells supported by the UE as defined in [19].
NOTE2:	If the UTRAN configures more than one measurement using events 2A, 2B, 2C or 2E  the UE measurement capabilities may be exceeded due to the necessary copying of 1A, 1B, 1C criteria.  To avoid this the UTRAN may configure one measurement to apply to multiple frequencies so that  the 1A, 1B, and 1C criteria will only be copied once.
NOTE3:	After a hard handover (see subclause 8.3.5), if the MEASUREMENT CONTROL message that restarts an inter-frequency measurement using the virtual active set does not include the IE "Inter-frequency set update", the UE behaviour regarding the virtual active set is not specified.
14.11.2	Virtual active set update during an inter-frequency measurement
For an inter-frequency measurement, the UE shall:
1>	apply the events of type 1a, 1b and 1c that were defined for the used frequency in other stored measurements of type "intra-frequency" at the time the inter-frequency measurement was last received with the IE "Inter-frequency set update" present; and
1>	update the virtual active set for the non-used frequencies considered in that measurement according to the following rules:
2>	if several events of type 1a (resp. 1b,1c) were defined for the used frequency when the inter-frequency measurement was last received with the IE "Inter-frequency set update" present, only the first 1a event (resp 1b, 1c) that was defined in the measurement with the lowest measurement identity shall apply to the non-used frequencies;
2>	all the cells considered in the inter-frequency measurements shall be able to affect the reporting range for event 1a and 1b. (i.e. the IE "Cells forbidden to affect reporting range" possibly stored for the intra-frequency measurements on the used frequency does not apply to the non-used frequencies considered in the inter-frequency measurement);
2>	the IEs "amount of reporting" and "reporting interval" that were stored for the intra-frequency measurements on the used frequency shall not be considered if reports of the virtual active set updates are needed.
2>	the measurement quantity and filter coefficient to be used is determined by the IE "intra-frequency measurement quantity" of the intra-frequency measurement from which the intra-frequency event configuration configuration is taken.
NOTE:	If the measurement quantity and filter coefficients to be used differ for the 1a, 1b, and 1c events applied then the UE behaviour is unspecified.
1>	if event 1a is applicable to the non-used frequencies considered in the inter-frequency measurement, always only consider monitored cells that are not in the virtual active set for this event, and:
2>	when this event is triggered (according to the criteria described in subclause 14.1.2.1) by a cell for a non-used frequency considered in that measurement:
3>	if the "Reporting deactivation threshold" is equal to 0, or if the "Reporting deactivation threshold" is different from 0 and the number of cells included in the virtual active set for that frequency is less than or equal to the "Reporting deactivation threshold":
4>	add the primary CPICH that enters the reporting range to the "virtual active set".
2>	if event 1b is applicable for the non-used frequencies considered in that inter-frequency measurement, always only consider cells in the virtual active set for this event, and when this event is triggered (according to the criteria described in subclause 14.1.2.2) by a cell for a non-used frequency considered in that measurement:
3>	if the number of cells included in the virtual active set is greater than 1:
4>	remove the primary CPICH that leaves the reporting range from the "virtual active set".
2>	if event 1c is applicable for the non-used frequencies considered in that inter-frequency measurement, always only consider monitored cells for this event, and when this event is triggered (according to the criteria described in subclause 14.1.2.3) by a cell for a non-used frequency considered in that measurement:
3>	if the "Reporting activation threshold" is equal to 0, or if the "Reporting activation threshold" is different from 0 and the number of cells included in the virtual active set for that frequency is greater than or equal to the "Reporting activation threshold":
4>	rank all active and non-active primary CPICHs and take the n best cells to create a new "virtual active set", where n is the number of active primary CPICHs in the "virtual active set".
1>	if Event 1a is not defined for the used frequency in other stored measurements of type "intra-frequency" at the time the inter-frequency measurement was set up:
2>	the UE shall continuously update the virtual active set to consist of all cells on frequency Fi considered in that inter-frequency measurement.
NOTE:	The UE needs to only update the virtual active set with up to the maximum number of interfrequency cells supported by the UE as defined in [19].
If none of the cells that are considered in the measurement on this frequency were measured, the UE may treat the virtual active set as empty and follow the appropriate initialisation procedured in subclause 14.11.1 when any relevant cell can first be measured.
If a cell is a member of the virtual active set and is removed from the variable CELL_INFO_LIST or removed from the list of cells pointed at by the IE "Cells for measurement" for the inter-frequency measurement then the UE shall remove the cell from the virtual active set.

If an inter-frequency measurement that initialised a virtual active set is released, then any virtual active set associated with this measurement shall also be released.
14.12	Provision and reception of RRC information between network nodes
14.12.0	General
In certain cases, e.g., when performing handover to UTRAN or when performing SRNC relocation, RRC information may need to be transferred between UTRAN nodes, between UTRAN and another RAT, between nodes within another RAT or between the UE and another RAT.
The RRC information exchanged between network nodes or between the UE and another RAT is typically transferred by means of RRC information containers. An RRC information container is a self-contained and extensible RRC information unit that may be used to transfer a number of different RRC messages, one at a time. As stated before, RRC information containers may be used to transfer RRC messages across interfaces other than the Uu interface. The RRC messages that may be included in RRC information containers have similar characteristics as the RRC messages that are transferred across the Uu interface.
The RRC messages that are sent to/ from the UE, e.g., HANDOVER TO UTRAN COMMAND, INTER RAT HANDOVER INFO are covered by (sub)clauses 8, 9, 10, 11.0-11.4 and 12 of this specification. The following subclauses concern RRC messages exchanged between network nodes.
In future versions of this specification, it is possible to extend the RRC messages transferred across interfaces other than Uu. For these RRC messages the same extension mechanism applies as defined for RRC messages transferred across the Uu interface, as is specified in subclause 10.1, i.e., both critical and non-critical extensions may be added.
The transfer syntax for RRC information containers and RRC messages transferred between network nodes is derived from their ASN.1 definitions by use of Packed Encoding Rules, unaligned (X.691). It should be noted that the encoder adds final padding to achieve octet alignment. The resulting octet string is, carried in a container, transferred between the network nodes.
When using a separate RRC information container for each endpoint, the receiving RRC protocol entity is able to interpret the received container; this means that the receiver need not take into account information about the (network interface) message used in transferring the container.
The following encoding rules apply in addition to what has been specified in X.691 [49]:
1>	When a bit string value is placed in a bit-field as specified in 15.6 to 15.11 in [11], the leading bit of the bit string value shall be placed in the leading bit of the bit-field, and the trailing bit of the bit string value shall be placed in the trailing bit of the bit-field.
NOTE:	The terms "leading bit" and "trailing bit" are defined in ITU-T Rec. X.680 | ISO/IEC 8824-1. When using the "bstring" notation, the leading bit of the bit string value is on the left, and the trailing bit of the bit string value is on the right.
14.12.0a	General error handling for RRC messages exchanged between network nodes
The error handling for RRC messages that are exchanged between network nodes applies the same principles as defined for other RRC messages.
Although the same principles apply for network nodes receiving unknown, unforeseen and erroneous RRC messages received in RRC information containers, the notification of the error should be done in a different manner, as specified in the following:
The network node receiving an invalid RRC message from another network node should:
1>	if the received RRC message was unknown, unforeseen or erroneous:
2>	prepare an RRC FAILURE INFO message, including the IE "Failure cause" set to "Protocol error" and the IE "Protocol error information" including an IE "Protocol error cause" which should be set as follows:
3>	to "ASN.1 violation or encoding error" upon receiving an RRC message for which the encoded message does not result in any valid abstract syntax value;
3>	to "Message type non-existent or not implemented" upon receiving an unknown RRC message type;
3>	to "Message extension not comprehended" upon receiving an RRC message including an undefined critical message extension;
3>	to "Information element value not comprehended" upon receiving an RRC message including an mandatory IE for which no default value is defined and for which either the value is set to spare or for which the encoded IE does not result in a valid transfer syntax. The same applies for conditional IEs, for which the conditions for presence are met, the IE is present but has a value set to spare or for which the encoded IE does not result in a valid transfer syntax;
3>	to "Information element missing" upon receiving an RRC information container with an absent conditional IE for which the conditions for presence are met.
1>	if there was another failure to perform the operation requested by the received RRC message:
2>	prepare an RRC FAILURE INFO message, including the IE "Failure cause" set to a value that reflects the failure cause.
1>	send the RRC FAILURE INFO message to the network node from which the invalid RRC protocol information was received.
NOTE 1:	The appropriate (failure) messages used across the network interfaces may not support the inclusion of a RRC information container. In this case, the information contained in the RRC FAILURE INFO message may need to be transferred otherwise e.g. by mapping to a cause value (e.g. a cause value in the RR-HANDOVER FAILURE message when there is a error associated with the RRC-HANDOVER TO UTRAN COMMAND message).
NOTE 2	In case the RRC procedure used to perform SRNS relocation fails e.g. due to non comprehension, the source RNC may notify the target RNC by including the diagnostics information (IEs "Protocol error" and "Protocol error information") in the "RRC message "SRNS Relocation" Info sent in the RRC information container" used for a subsequent relocation request.
14.12.1	RRC Information to target RNC
The RRC information container "RRC Information to target RNC" may either be sent from source RNC or from another RAT. In case of handover to UTRAN, this information originates from another RAT, while in case of SRNC relocation the RRC information originates from the source RNC. In case of handover to UTRAN, the RRC information transferred may provide UTRAN specific information, as defined in the INTER RAT HANDOVER INFO WITH INTER RAT CAPABILITIES message, that the target RNC needs when preparing the handover command message. In case of SRNC relocation and handover/cell reselection from GERAN Iu mode, the RRC information transferred specifies the configuration of RRC and the lower layers it controls, e.g., including the radio bearer and transport channel configuration. It is used by the target RNC to initialise RRC and the lower layer protocols to facilitate SRNC relocation and handover/cell reselection from GERAN Iu mode in a manner transparent to the UE.
RFC 3095 CONTEXT INFO is used to transfer the compressor and decompressor context information of the RFC 3095 protocol from source RNC to target RNC.

14.12.2	RRC information, target RNC to source RNC
There are 2 possible cases for RNC relocation:
1.	The UE is already under control of target RNC; and
2.	The SRNC Relocation with Hard Handover (UE still under control of SRNC), but UE is moving to a location controlled by the target RNC (based on measurement information).
In case 1 the relocation is transparent to the UE and there is no "reverse" direction container. The SRNC just assigns the 'serving' function to the target RNC, which then becomes the Serving RNC.
In case 2 the relocation is initiated by SRNC, which also provides the RRC Initialisation Information to the target RNC. Base on this information, the target RNC prepares the Hard Handover Message ( "Physical channel reconfiguration" (subclause 8.2.6), "radio bearer establishment" (subclause 8.2.1), "Radio bearer reconfiguration" (subclause 8.2.2), "Radio bearer release" (subclause 8.2.3) or "Transport channel reconfiguration" (subclause 8.2.4).
In case 2 two possibilities are defined in order to transmit the relocation message from the target RNC to the source RNC which can be chosen by the source RNC by including or not including the IE "RB Id for handover message" in the IE "SRNS Relocation Info".
In case the IE "RB Id for handover message" has been received by the target RNC in the IE "SRNS Relocation Info", the target RNC should choose the IE "DL DCCH message" and include the DL DCCH message that should be transmitted transparently to the UE by the source RNC. In that case, the target RNC is integrity protecting the message if applicable.
If the target RNC did not receive the IE "RB Id for handover message" in the IE "SRNS Relocation Info" the target RNC should use another choice. In that case, the source RNC should integrity protect the message before transmitting it to the UE if applicable.
The source RNC then transmits the Handover Message to the UE, which then performs the handover.
In the successful case, the UE transmits an XXX COMPLETE message, using the new configuration, to the target RNC.
In case of failure, the UE transmits an XXX FAILURE, using the old configuration, to the source RNC and the RRC context remains unchanged (has to be confirmed and checked with the SRNS relocation procedure).

With the presence or absence of the IE "RB identity for Hard Handover message" the source RNC indicates to the target SRNC whether the source RNC expects to receive the choice "DL DCCH message" in the IE "RRC information, target RNC to source RNC" in case the SRNS relocation is of type "UE involved". Furthermore the target RNC uses this information for the calculation of the MAC-I.

Description of RRC state transitions
This annex contains Stage 2 description of RRC states and state transitions.
B.1	RRC states and state transitions including GSM
After power on, the UE stays in Idle Mode until it transmits a request to establish an RRC Connection. In Idle Mode the connection of the UE is closed on all layers of the access stratum. In Idle Mode the UE is identified by non-access stratum identities such as IMSI, TMSI and P-TMSI. In addition, the UTRAN has no own information about the individual Idle Mode UEs, and it can only address e.g. all UEs in a cell or all UEs monitoring a paging occasion. The UE behaviour within this mode is described in [4].
The UTRA RRC Connected Mode is entered when the RRC Connection is established. The UE is assigned a radio network temporary identity (RNTI) to be used as UE identity on common transport channels.
The RRC states within UTRA RRC Connected Mode reflect the level of UE connection and which transport channels that can be used by the UE.
For inactive stationary data users the UE may fall back to PCH on both the Cell and URA levels. That is, upon the need for paging, the UTRAN checks the current level of connection of the given UE, and decides whether the paging message is sent within the URA, or should it be sent via a specific cell.
B.2	Transition from Idle Mode to UTRA RRC Connected Mode
The transition to the UTRA RRC Connected Mode from the Idle Mode can only be initiated by the UE by transmitting a request for an RRC Connection. The event is triggered either by a paging request from the network or by a request from upper layers in the UE.
When the UE receives a message from the network that confirms the RRC connection establishment, the UE enters the CELL_FACH or CELL_DCH state of UTRA RRC Connected Mode.
In the case of a failure to establish the RRC Connection the UE goes back to Idle Mode. Possible causes are radio link failure, a received reject response from the network or lack of response from the network (timeout).
B.2.1	Transitions for Emergency Calls
Refer to [4] for all states and procedures referred to in this subclause. When UE leaves idle mode from state Camped on any cell in order to make an emergency call, moving to state Connected mode (emergency calls only), the UE shall attempt to access the current serving cell. If the access attempt to the serving cell fails the UE shall use the Cell Reselection procedure. If no acceptable cell is found, the UE shall use the Any cell selection. When returning to idle mode, the UE shall use the procedure Cell selection when leaving connected mode in order to find an acceptable cell to camp on, state Camped on any cell.
B.3	UTRA RRC Connected Mode States and Transitions
B.3.1	CELL_DCH state
The CELL_DCH state is characterised by
-	For TDD: A dedicated physical channel is allocated to the UE in uplink and downlink or a dedicated physical channel is allocated to the UE in the uplink and HS_DSCH_RECEPTION is set to TRUE.
-	A dedicated physical channel is allocated to the UE in uplink and downlink. 
-	For TDD:
-	E_DCH_TRANSMISSION is set to TRUE and HS_DSCH_RECEPTION is set to TRUE.
-	E_DCH_TRANSMISSION is set to TRUE and a dedicated physical channel is allocated to the UE in the downlink.
-	The UE is known on cell level according to its current active set.
-	Dedicated transport channels, downlink and uplink (TDD) shared transport channels, and a combination of these transport channels can be used by the UE.
The CELL_DCH-state is entered from the Idle Mode through the setup of an RRC connection, or by establishing a dedicated physical channel from the CELL_FACH state.
In TDD a PDSCH may be assigned to the UE in this state, to be used for a DSCH. A PUSCH may also be assigned to the UE in this state, to be used for a USCH. If PDSCH or PUSCH are used for TDD, a FACH transport channel may be assigned to the UE for reception of physical shared channel allocation messages.
B.3.1.1	Transition from CELL_DCH to Idle Mode
Transition to Idle Mode is realised through the release of the RRC connection.
B.3.1.2	Transition from CELL_DCH to CELL_FACH state
Transition to CELL_FACH state occurs when all dedicated channels have been released, which may be
a)	via explicit signalling (e.g. PHYSICAL CHANNEL RECONFIGURATION, Radio Bearer Reconfiguration, Radio Bearer Release, Radio Bearer Setup, Transport Channel Reconfiguration, etc.).
at the end of the time period for which the dedicated channel was allocated (TDD)
B.3.1.3	Transition from CELL_DCH to CELL_PCH state
Transition to CELL_PCH state occurs via explicit signalling (e.g. PHYSICAL CHANNEL RECONFIGURATION, Radio Bearer Reconfiguration, Radio Bearer Release, Radio Bearer Setup, Transport Channel Reconfiguration, etc.).
B.3.1.4	Transition from CELL_DCH to URA_PCH state
Transition to URA_PCH state occurs via explicit signalling (e.g. PHYSICAL CHANNEL RECONFIGURATION, Radio Bearer Reconfiguration, Radio Bearer Release, Radio Bearer Setup, Transport Channel Reconfiguration, etc.).
B.3.1.5	Radio Resource Allocation tasks (CELL_DCH)
For the DCH, several physical channel allocation strategies may be applied. The allocations can be either permanent (needing a DCH release message) or based on time or amount-of-data.
Resource allocation can be done separately for each packet burst with fast signalling on the DCH
For each radio frame the UE and the network indicate the current data rate (in uplink and downlink respectively) using the transport format combination indicator (TFCI). However, in TDD, DCH and DSCH or USCH may be mapped on different CCTrCHs, their TFCI are totally independent. DCH transmission is not modified by the simultaneous existence of DSCH/USCH. If the configured set of combinations (i.e. transport format set for one transport channel) are found to be insufficient to retain the QoS requirements for a transport channel, the network initiates a reconfiguration of the transport format set (TFS) for that transport channel. This reconfiguration can be done during or in between data transmission. Further, the network can reconfigure the physical channel allowing an increase or decrease of the peak data rate.
For the uplink data transmission, the UE reports the observed traffic volume to the network in order for the network to re-evaluate the current allocation of resources. This report contains e.g. the amount of data to be transmitted or the buffer status in the UE.
B.3.1.6	RRC Connection mobility tasks (CELL_DCH)
Depending on the amount and frequency of data macrodiversity (soft handover) may or may not be applied.
The RRC Connection mobility is handled by measurement reporting, soft handover and Timing re-initialised or Timing-maintained hard handover procedures.
B.3.1.7	UE Measurements (CELL_DCH)
The UE performs measurements and transmit measurement reports according to the measurement control information.
The UE uses the connected mode measurement control information received in other states until new measurement control information has been assigned to the UE.
B.3.1.8	Acquisition of system information (CELL_DCH)
FDD UEs with certain capabilities reads system information broadcast on FACH.
TDD UEs reads the BCH to acquire valid system information. For each acquisition, the UE may need different combinations of system information broadcast on BCH. The scheduling on the broadcast channel is done in such way that the UE knows when the requested information can be found.
B.3.2	CELL_FACH state
The CELL_FACH state is characterised by:
-	No dedicated physical channel is allocated to the UE.
-	The UE continuously monitors a FACH in the downlink.
-	The UE is assigned a default common or shared transport channel in the uplink (e.g. RACH) that it can use anytime according to the access procedure for that transport channel.
-	The position of the UE is known by UTRAN on cell level according to the cell where the UE last made a cell update.
-	In TDD mode, one or several USCH or DSCH transport channels may have been established.
B.3.2.1	Transition from CELL_FACH to CELL_DCH state
A transition occurs, when a dedicated physical channel is established via explicit signalling (e.g. PHYSICAL CHANNEL RECONFIGURATION, Radio Bearer Reconfiguration, Radio Bearer Release, Radio Bearer Setup, Transport Channel Reconfiguration, etc.).
B.3.2.2	Transition from CELL_FACH to CELL_PCH state
The transition occurs when UTRAN orders the UE to move to CELL_PCH state, which is done via explicit signalling (e.g. CELL UPDATE CONFIRM, RADIO BEARER RECONFIGURATION, etc.).
B.3.2.3	Transition from CELL_FACH to Idle Mode
Upon release of the RRC connection, the UE moves to the idle mode.
B.3.2.4	Transition from CELL_FACH to URA_PCH State
The transition occurs when UTRAN orders the UE to move to URA _PCH state, which is done via explicit signalling (e.g. URA UPDATE CONFIRM, RADIO BEARER RECONFIGURATION, etc.).
B.3.2.5	Radio Resource Allocation Tasks (CELL_FACH)
In the CELL_ FACH state the UE will monitor an FACH. It is enabled to transmit uplink control signals and it may be able to transmit small data packets on the RACH.
The network can assign the UE transport channel parameters (e.g. transport format sets) in advance, to be used when a DCH is used. Upon assignment of the physical channel for DCH, the UE moves to CELL_DCH state and uses the pre-assigned TFS for the DCH.
If no UE dedicated physical channel or transport channel configuration has been assigned, the UE uses the common physical channel and transport channel configuration according to the system information.
For the uplink data transmission, the UE reports the observed traffic volume to the network in order for the network to re-evaluate the current allocation of resources. This report contains e.g. the amount of data to be transmitted or the buffer status in the UE.
When there is either user or control data to transmit, a selection procedure determines whether the data should be transmitted on a common transport channel, or if a transition to CELL_DCH should be executed. The selection is dynamic and depends on e.g. traffic parameters (amount of data, packet burst frequency).
In the TDD mode, the UTRAN can assign USCH / DSCH resources to the UE in CELL_FACH state. When USCH / DSCH resources are assigned, the UE will continue to monitor FACHs, depending on the UE capability. The UE may use the USCH / DSCH to transmit signalling messages or user data in the uplink and / or the downlink using USCH and / or DSCH when resources are allocated to cell and UE is assigned use of those USCH / DSCH.
For the uplink data transmission on USCH the UE reports to the network the traffic volume (current size of RLC data buffers), The UTRAN can use these measurement reports to re-evaluate the current allocation of the USCH / DSCH resources.
B.3.2.6	RRC Connection mobility tasks (CELL_FACH)
In this state the location of the UE is known on cell level. A cell update procedure is used to report to the UTRAN, when the UE selects a new cell to observe the common downlink channels of a new cell. Downlink data transmission on the FACH can be started without prior paging.
The UE monitors the broadcast channel and system information on BCCH of its own and neighbour cells and from this the need for the updating of cell location is identified.
The UE performs cell reselection and upon selecting a new UTRA cell, it initiates a cell update procedure. Upon selecting a new cell belonging to another radio access system than UTRA, the UE enters idle mode and makes an access to that system according to its specifications.
B.3.2.7	UE Measurements (CELL_FACH)
The UE performs measurements and transmit measurement reports according to the measurement control information.
By default, the UE uses the measurement control information broadcast within the system information. However, for measurements for which the network also provides measurement control information within a measurement control message, the latter information takes precedence.
B.3.2.8	Transfer and update of system information (CELL_FACH)
The UE reads the BCH to acquire valid system information. For each acquisition, the UE may need different combinations of system information broadcast on BCH. The scheduling on the broadcast channel is done in such way that the UE knows when the requested information can be found.
When the system information is modified, the scheduling information is updated to reflect the changes in system information transmitted on BCH. The new scheduling information is broadcast on FACH in order to inform UEs about the changes. If the changes are applicable for the UE, the modified system information is read on BCH.
B.3.3	CELL_PCH state
The CELL_PCH state is characterised by:
-	No dedicated physical channel is allocated to the UE.
-	The UE selects a PCH with the algorithm specified in subclause 8.5.19, and uses DRX for monitoring the selected PCH via an associated PICH.
-	No uplink activity is possible.
-	The position of the UE is known by UTRAN on cell level according to the cell where the UE last made a cell update in CELL_FACH state.
The DCCH logical channel cannot be used in this state. If the network wants to initiate any activity, it needs to make a paging request on the PCCH logical channel in the known cell to initiate any downlink activity.
B.3.3.1	Transition from CELL_PCH to CELL_FACH state
The UE is transferred to CELL_FACH state:
a)	by paging from UTRAN (PAGING TYPE1 message)
b)	through any uplink access
B.3.3.2	Radio Resource Allocation Tasks (CELL_PCH)
In CELL_PCH state no resources have been granted for data transmission. For this purpose, a transition to another state has to be executed.
The UE may use Discontinuous Reception (DRX) in order to reduce power consumption. When DRX is used the UE needs only to receive at one paging occasion per DRX cycle. The UE may be instructed to use a specific DRX cycle length by the network. The UE determines its paging occasions in the same way as for Idle Mode, see [4].
B.3.3.3	RRC Connection mobility tasks (CELL_PCH)
In the CELL_PCH state, the UE mobility is performed through cell reselection procedures, which may differ from the one defined in [4].
The UE performs cell reselection and upon selecting a new UTRA cell, it moves to CELL_FACH state and initiates a cell update procedure in the new cell. After the cell update procedure has been performed, the UE changes its state back to CELL_PCH state if neither the UE nor the network has any more data to transmit.
Upon selecting a new cell belonging to another radio access system than UTRA, the UE enters idle mode and make an access to that system according to its specifications.
In case of low UE activity, UTRAN may want to reduce the cell-updating overhead by ordering the UE to move to the URA_PCH State. This transition is made via the CELL_FACH state. UTRAN may apply an inactivity timer, and optionally, a counter, which counts the number of cell updates e.g. UTRAN orders the UE to move to URA_PCH when the number of cell updates has exceeded certain limits (network parameter).
B.3.3.4	UE Measurements (CELL_PCH)
The UE performs measurements and transmit measurement reports according to the measurement control information.
The UE uses the measurement control information according to the system information when no UE dedicated measurement control information has been assigned.
B.3.3.5	Transfer and update of system information (CELL_PCH)
The UE reads the BCH to acquire valid system information. For each acquisition, the UE may need different combinations of system information broadcast on BCH. The scheduling on the broadcast channel is done in such way that the UE knows when the requested information can be found.
B.3.4	URA_PCH State
The URA_PCH state is characterised by:
-	No dedicated channel is allocated to the UE.
-	The UE selects a PCH with the algorithm specified in subclause 8.5.19, and uses DRX for monitoring the selected PCH via an associated PICH.
-	No uplink activity is possible.
-	The location of the UE is known on UTRAN Registration area level according to the URA assigned to the UE during the last URA update in CELL_FACH state.
The DCCH logical channel cannot be used in this state. If the network wants to initiate any activity, it needs to make a paging request on the PCCH logical channel within the URA where the location of the UE is known. If the UE needs to transmit anything to the network, it goes to the CELL_FACH state. The transition to URA_PCH State can be controlled with an inactivity timer, and optionally, with a counter that counts the number of cell updates. When the number of cell updates has exceeded certain limits (a network parameter), then the UE changes to the URA_PCH State.
URA updating is initiated by the UE, which, upon the detection of the Registration area, sends the network the Registration area update information on the RACH of the new cell.
B.3.4.1	Transition from URA_PCH State to CELL_FACH State (URA_PCH)
Any activity causes the UE to be transferred to CELL_ FACH State.
a)	Uplink access is performed by RACH.
b)	by paging from UTRAN ( PAGING TYPE1 message ).
NOTE:	The release of an RRC connection is possible in the URA_PCH state. UE in URA_PCH is able to go to idle when triggered by paging type 1 message in case ''Release indicator'' has the value ''Release''.
B.3.4.2	Radio Resource Allocation Tasks (URA_PCH)
In URA_PCH State no resources have been granted for data transmission. For this purpose, a transition to CELL_FACH State has to be executed.
The UE may use Discontinuous Reception (DRX) in order to reduce power consumption. When DRX is used the UE needs only to receive at one paging occasion per DRX cycle. The UE may be instructed to use a specific DRX cycle length by the network. The UE determines its paging occasions in the same way as for Idle Mode, see [4].
B.3.4.3	RRC Connection mobility tasks (URA_PCH)
In URA_PCH State the location of a UE is known on UTRAN Registration area level.
In this state, the UE mobility is performed through URA reselection procedures, which may differ from the definitions in [4]. The UE performs cell reselection and upon selecting a new UTRA cell belonging to a URA that does not match the URA used by the UE, the UE moves to CELL_FACH state and initiates a URA update towards the network. After the URA update procedure has been performed, the UE changes its state back to URA_PCH state if neither the UE nor the network has any more data to transmit.
Upon selecting a new cell belonging to another radio access system than UTRA, the UE enters idle mode and makes an access to that system according to its specifications.
B.3.4.4	UE Measurements (URA_PCH)
The UE performs measurements and transmit measurement reports according to the measurement control information.
The UE uses the measurement control information according to the system information when no UE dedicated measurement control information has been assigned.
B.3.4.5	Transfer and update of system information (URA_PCH)
The same mechanisms to transfer and update system information as for state CELL_PCH are applicable for UEs in URA_PCH state.
B.3.5	States and Transitions for Cell Reselection in URA_PCH, CELL_PCH, and CELL_FACH

Figure B.3.5-1: UTRA RRC Connected mode cell reselection for URA_PCH, CELL_PCH, and CELL_FACH
In some states the UE performs cell reselection procedures. The UE selects a suitable cell (defined in [4]) and radio access technology based on connected mode radio measurements and cell reselection criteria.
Figure B.3.5-1 shows the states and procedures in the cell reselection process in connected mode.
When a cell reselection is triggered, the UE evaluates the cell reselection criteria based on radio measurements, and if a better cell is found that cell is selected, procedure Cell reselection (see [4]). If the change of cell implies a change of radio access technology, the RRC connection is released, and the UE enters idle mode of the other RAT. If no suitable cell is found in the cell reselection procedure, the UE eventually enters idle mode.
When an Initial cell reselection is triggered, the UE shall use the Initial cell reselection procedure (see [4]) to find a suitable cell. One example where this procedure is triggered is at radio link failure, where the UE may trigger an initial cell reselection in order to request re-establishment of the RRC connection. If the UE is unable to find a suitable cell, the UE eventually enters idle mode.
B.4	Inter-RAT handover with CS domain services
When using CS domain services, UTRAN is using an Inter-Radio access system Handover Procedure and GSM is using a Handover procedure for the transition from UTRA RRC Connected Mode to GSM Connected Mode.
B.5	Inter-RAT handover with PS domain services
When using PS domain services, the UE can initiate cell reselection from a GSM/GPRS cell to a UTRAN cell and then uses the RRC Connection Establishment procedure for the transition to UTRA RRC Connected mode. It is also possible for the BSS to initiate a UTRA Inter-RAT Handover to seamlessly relocate the UE to UTRAN. In this latter case there is no need to return the UE to Idle Mode (GPRS Packet Idle Mode) and the UE immediately moves to RRC connected state in the UTRAN.
In the case that cell reselection is used, when the RRC Connection is established from Idle Mode (GPRS Packet Idle Mode) the RRC CONNECTION REQUEST message contains an indication, that UTRAN needs to continue an already established GPRS UE context from the CN. This indication allows UTRAN to e.g. prioritise the RRC CONNECTION REQUEST from the UE.
In UTRA RRC connected mode UTRAN may use UE or network initiated cell reselection to change from a UTRAN cell to a GSM/GPRS cell. If the cell reselection was successful the UE enters Idle Mode (GPRS Packet Idle Mode). The UE sends a packet channel request from Idle Mode (GPRS Packet Idle mode) to establish a Temporary Block flow and enter GPRS Packet Transfer Mode. In the GPRS Packet Transfer Mode the UE sends a RA Update request message. The RA Update Request message sent from the UE contains an indication that GSM/GPRS need to continue an already established UTRAN UE context from the CN. This means that the RA Update request is always sent for the transition from UTRA RRC Connected Mode to GSM/GPRS regardless if the RA is changed or not. 
Alternatively, the UTRAN may use an Inter-System Relocation (PS Handover) to relocate a UTRA RRC connected UE directly to GPRS Packet Transfer Mode in GERAN.
NOTE:	The reason for using RA update instead of a new message is to reduce the impact on the existing GSM/GPRS specification.
B.6	Inter-RAT handover with simultaneous PS and CS domain services
B.6.1	Inter-RAT handover UTRAN to GSM / BSS
For a UE in CELL_DCH state using both CS and PS Domain services the Inter-RAT handover procedure is based on measurement reports from the UE but initiated from UTRAN.
The UE performs the Inter-RAT handover from UTRA RRC Connected Mode to GSM Connected Mode first. When the UE has sent handover complete message to GSM / BSS the UE initiates a temporary block flow towards GPRS and sends a RA update request.
If the Inter-RAT handover from UTRA RRC Connected Mode to GSM Connected Mode was successful the handover is considered as successful regardless if the UE was able to establish a temporary block flow or not towards GPRS.
In case of Inter-RAT handover failure the UE has the possibility to go back to UTRA RRC Connected Mode and re-establish the connection in the state it originated from.
B.6.2	Inter-RAT handover GSM / BSS to UTRAN
For a UE in GSM Connected Mode using both CS and PS domain services the Inter-RAT handover procedure is based on measurement reports from the UE but initiated from GSM / BSS.
The UE performs the Inter-RAT handover from GSM Connected Mode to UTRA RRC Connected Mode.
In UTRA RRC Connected Mode both services are established in parallel.
If the Inter-RAT handover from GSM Connected mode to UTRA RRC Connected Mode was successful the handover is considered as successful.
In case of Inter-RAT handover failure the UE has the possibility to go back to GSM Connected Mode and re-establish the connection in the state it originated from.
Annex C (informative):
Description for the Compressed Coding of Pre-defined configurations included in the INTER RAT HANDOVER INFO message
This annex contains a description of the compressed coding of the IE "Predefined configuration status information compressed" (see subclause 10.3.4.5b) included in the INTER RAT HANDOVER INFO message.
C.1	Definitions
Pre-defined configuration set with different value tags: This is a set of consecutive positions for which pre-defined configurations are stored with different value tags. The set cannot include positions for which no pre-defined configuration is stored. 
Pre-defined configuration list with variable size: This is the variable sized list consisting of the value tags corresponding to the remaining positions after the "Pre-defined configuration sets with different value tags" have been formed. This will also indicate not stored pre-defined configurations, either explicitly or implicitly (i.e. in the case that there are no more stored configurations until the end of the variable sized list). This is highlighted in figures C.2-1 and C.2-2. 
C.2	Examples of the methodology
From figure C.2-1 it can be seen that there are two "Pre-defined configuration sets with different value tags".
The start position of Set1 is "1" with a list of 7 pre-defined configurations {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}.
The start position of Set2 is "10" with a list of 6 pre-defined configurations {10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15}. 
The "Pre-defined configurations list with variable size" has a start position of 0, and includes all of the pre-defined configurations not included in the sets {0, 8, 9}. The value tag at position 9 is not stored. This does not need to be explicitly indicated in the coding as "not stored" because there are no stored pre-defined configurations positioned after this in the list.
Figure C.2-1: Example scenario where non-stored pre-defined configurations do not need to be explicitly indicated

Figure C.2-2 is similar to Figure C.2-1. However in this case for the "Pre-defined configurations list with variable size", the pre-defined configuration in position 8 is not stored. This needs to be explicitly indicated in the coding as "not stored" because there is a stored pre-defined configuration (position 9) positioned after this in the list.
Figure C.2-2: Example scenario where non-stored pre-defined configurations need to be explicitly indicated
Annex D (Normative):
Implementation of Domain Specific Access Control (DSAC) in UEs of 3GPP Release 5
UEs of 3GPP Release 5 implementing the domain specific access class control feature but not implementing the network sharing feature shall act on the domain specific access class restriction indicated by the IE "Domain Specific Access Restriction Parameters For PLMN Of MIB" if present, and otherwise apply the access restrictions indicated by the IE "Cell Access Restriction".
