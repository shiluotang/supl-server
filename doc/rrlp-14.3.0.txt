2	Functionality of Protocol
2.1	General
The present document defines one generic RRLP message that is used to transfer Location Services (LCS) related information between the Mobile Station (MS) and the Serving Mobile Location Centre (SMLC). Usage of the RRLP protocol on a general level is described in 3GPP TS 43.059 that includes Stage 2 description of LCS.
One message includes one of the following components:
-	Measure Position Request;
-	Measure Position Response;
-	Assistance Data;
-	Assistance Data Acknowledgement;
-	Protocol Error;
-	Positioning Capability Request;
-	Positioning Capability Response;
-	Multilateration Timing Advance Request.
Next sub-clauses describe the usage of these components.
Delivery of components may be supported in the RRLP level using pseudo-segmentation by sending several shorter messages instead of one long message. Any assistance data that is successfully delivered to an MS and acknowledged prior to the interruption of the positioning procedure by an event like handover, or by any other event that causes an MS to terminate the positioning procedure or delivery of assistance data (see 3GPP TS 43.059), shall be retained by the MS and need not be resent by the SMLC when positioning or delivery of assistance data is again re-attempted.
The RRLP maximum PDU size is 242 octets. If the amount of data that needs to be sent is larger than RRLP maximum PDU size, the RRLP pseudo-segmentation shall be used. The RRLP pseudo-segmentation is the use of several RRLP components (one in each RRLP message) to deliver a large amount of information. For SMLC to MS messages, the Assistance Data component is the one that is sent several times in order to deliver the information. For MS to SMLC messages, the Measure Position Response component may be sent twice in order to deliver the information. Legacy MS and SMLC (3GPP Rel-4 or older) may send RRLP components that are larger than the RRLP maximum PDU size. In this case lower level segmentation will be used.
2.2	Position Measurement Procedure
The purpose of this procedure is to enable the SMLC to request for position measurement data or location estimate from the MS, and the MS to respond to the request with measurements or location estimate.

Figure 2.1: Position Measurement procedure
1.	The Measure Position Request component and any Assistance Data Delivery Procedure may be preceded by a Positioning Capability Transfer procedure (see sub-clause 2.3a) to transfer the MS positioning capabilities to the SMLC.
2.	The Measure Position Request component may be preceded by an Assistance Data Delivery Procedure (see sub-clause 2.3) to deliver some or all of the entire set of assistance data that is needed by the subsequent positioning procedure (steps 3-5).
3.	The SMLC sends the Measure Position Request component in a RRLP message to the MS. The component includes QoS, other instructions, and possible assistance data to the MS. The RRLP message contains a reference number and an extended reference ID of the request.
4.	The MS sends a RRLP message containing the Protocol Error component to the SMLC, if there is a problem that prevents the MS to receive a complete and understandable Measure Position Request component. The RRLP message contains the reference number and, if available, the extended reference ID included in the Measure Position Request received incomplete. The Protocol Error component includes a more specific reason. When the SMLC receives the Protocol Error component, it may try to resend the Measure Position Request (go back to the step 3), abort location, or start a new position measurement procedure (e.g. with updated assistance data).
5.	The MS tries to perform the requested location measurements, and possibly calculates it own position. When the MS has location measurements, location estimate, or an error indication (measurements/location estimation not possible), it sends the results in the Measure Position Response component to the SMLC. The RRLP message contains the reference number and, if received, the extended reference ID of the request originally received in the step 3. The MS may optionally send one additional Measure Position Response component in a second RRLP message to the SMLC if the amount of information it needs to transfer to the SMLC is too large to fit into one single Measure Position Response component (uplink RRLP pseudo-segmentation). This RRLP message also contains the reference number and, if received, the extended reference ID of the request originally received in the step 3. If two components are sent, the MS shall indicate in the first component that it is the first of many components and in the second one that it is the second of many components. If there is a problem that prevents the SMLC to receive a complete and understandable Measure Position Response component, the SMLC may decide to abort location, or start a new position measurement procedure instead. If additional Measure Position Response components are received by the SMLC after the 1st and optional 2nd one, they shall be ignored.
2.3	Assistance Data Delivery Procedure
The purpose of this procedure is to enable the SMLC to send assistance data to the MS related to position measurement and/or location calculation. Notice that RRLP protocol is not used by the MS to request assistance data, only to deliver it to the MS. The entire set of assistance data (i.e. the total amount of assistance data that the SMLC has decided to send in the current procedure) may be delivered in one or several Assistance Data components. In this case steps 1 and 3 below may be repeated several times by the SMLC. If several components are sent, the SMLC shall await the acknowledgement of each component before the next Assistance Data component is sent. If Assistance Data Delivery is used as part of the Position Measurement Procedure, as described in sub-clause 2.2, then some assistance data may be delivered in the final RRLP Measure Position Request.

Figure 2.2: Assistance Data Delivery procedure
1.	The SMLC sends the Assistance Data component to the MS. The component includes assistance data for location measurement and/or location calculation. The RRLP message contains a reference number and an extended reference ID of the delivery. The More Assistance Data To Be Sent Element in the Assistance Data component is used by the SMLC to indicate to the MS if either more Assistance Data components (in the current Assistance Data Delivery procedure) or a final RRLP Measure Position Request (if the Assistance Data Delivery Procedure forms part of a Position Measurement procedure as described in sub-clause 2.2) will be sent.
2.	The MS sends a RRLP message containing the Protocol Error component to the SMLC, if there is a problem that prevents the MS to receive a complete and understandable Assistance Data component. The RRLP message contains the reference number and, if available, the extended reference ID included in the Assistance Data component received incomplete. The Protocol Error component includes a more specific reason. When the SMLC receives the Protocol Error component, it may try to resend the Assistance Data component (go back to the step 1), send a new measure Assistance Data set (e.g. with updated assistance data), or abort the delivery.
3.	When the MS has received a complete Assistance Data component, it send the Assistance Data Acknowledgement component to the SMLC. The RRLP message contains the reference number of the Assistance Data originally received in step 1.
2.3a	Positioning Capability Transfer Procedure
The purpose of this procedure is to enable the SMLC to obtain the positioning capabilities of the MS, the types of assistance supported and the types of assistance data that may be needed from the SMLC. MS support for this procedure can be indicated to the SMLC using the MS Classmark 3 IE for GSM (see 3GPP TS 24.008), the PS LCS Capability IE for GERAN Gb mode (see 3GPP TS 24.008) and the MS Positioning Capability IE for GERAN Iu mode (see 3GPP TS 44.118).

Figure 2.3: Positioning Capability Transfer procedure
1.	The SMLC sends the Positioning Capability Request component to the MS. The RRLP message contains a reference number and an extended reference ID of the request. The message may contain indication of GANSS positioning support.
2.	The MS sends a RRLP message containing the Protocol Error component to the SMLC, if there is a problem that prevents the MS to receive a complete and understandable Positioning Capability Request component. The RRLP message contains the reference number and the extended reference ID included in the Positioning Capability Request component. The Protocol Error component includes a more specific reason. When the SMLC receives the Protocol Error component, it may try to resend the Positioning Capability Request component (go back to the step 1) or abort the request.
3.	When the MS has received a complete Positioning Capability Request component, it sends the Positioning Capability Response component to the SMLC. The component shall include the positioning capabilities of the MS and the types of supported assistance data. The component may include the types of assistance needed by the MS to obtain a location estimate or positioning measurements. The RRLP message also contains the reference number and extended Reference ID of the Positioning Capability Request originally received in step 1.
2.4	(void)
2.5	Error Handling Procedures
2.5.1	General
In this sub-clause it is described how a receiving entity behaves in cases when it receives erroneous data or detects that certain data is missing.
2.5.1a	Message Too Short
When MS receives a RRLP message, that is too short to contain all mandatory IEs, the MS sends a Protocol Error component with indication "Message Too Short". If the Reference Number can be found, it is included. If the Reference Number is not available, the Reference Number of the RRLP message carrying the Protocol Error component is set to '0'. If the Extended Reference IE can be found, it shall be included in the returned Protocol Error Component. If the Extended Reference IE is not available, an Extended Reference IE shall not be included. The original sending entity that receives the Protocol Error, may then resend the original message, or abort the procedure.
2.5.2	Unknown Reference Number
A SMLC detects that it has received a RRLP message with an unknown or invalid Reference Number, when one or more of the following conditions occur:
-	a Measure Position Response, Assistance Data Acknowledgement, Positioning Capability Response or Protocol Error component is received with a Reference Number that the SMLC has not sent in a Measure Position Request, Assistance Data or Positioning Capability Request component during a pending Position Measurement, Assistance Data Delivery or Positioning Capability Transfer procedure.
-	a Measure Position Response, Positioning Capability Response or Protocol Error component is received with an Extended Reference IE value that the SMLC has not sent in a Measure Position Request Assistance Data or Positioning Capability Request component during a pending Position Measurement, Assistance Data Delivery or Positioning Capability Transfer procedure.
-	a Measure Position Response, Positioning Capability Response or Protocol Error component is received with a Reference Number and an Extended Reference IE value that the SMLC has not sent together in the same Measure Position Request, the same Assistance Data or the same Positioning Capability Request component during a pending Position Measurement, Assistance Data Delivery or Positioning Capability Transfer procedure.
The SMLC shall then discard the message. If the SMLC receives a Measure Position Response or a Protocol Error component containing no Extended Reference ID, then the SMLC shall assume that the target MS is for Release 4 or earlier and shall only verify the received Reference Number.
2.5.3	Missing Information Element or Component Element
When MS receives a RRLP message, that does not contain IEs or component elements expected to be present, the MS sends a Protocol Error component with indication "Missing Information Element or Component Element". If the Reference Number can be found, it is included. If the Reference Number is not available, the Reference Number of the RRLP message carrying the Protocol Error component is set to '0'. If the Extended Reference IE can be found, it shall be included in the returned Protocol Error Component. If the Extended Reference IE is not available, an Extended Reference IE shall not be included. The SMLC that receives the Protocol Error, may then resend the original message, or abort the procedure.
2.5.4	Incorrect Data
When MS receives a RRLP message, that is contains IEs or elements of components that are syntactically incorrect, the MS sends a Protocol Error component with indication "Incorrect Data". If the Reference Number can be found, it is included. If the Reference Number is not available, the Reference Number of the RRLP message carrying the Protocol Error component is set to '0'. If the Extended Reference IE can be found, it shall be included in the returned Protocol Error Component. If the Extended Reference IE is not available, an Extended Reference IE shall not be included. The SMLC that receives the Protocol Error, may then resend the original message, or abort the procedure.
2.5.5	Repeated Component
When after the reception of a Measure Position Request component, but before responding with a Measure Position Response or a Protocol Error component, the MS receives a new RRLP message with the Measure Position Request component, it acts as follows:
-	if the old and new Measure Position Request components have the same Reference Number and, if included, the same Extended Reference IE, the MS ignores the later component;
-	if the old and new Measure Position Request components have different Reference Numbers or, if included, different Extended Reference IEs or if one Measure Position Request component (old or new) contains an Extended Reference IE but the other component does not, the MS aborts activity for the former component, and starts to acts according to the later component, and sends a response to that.
When after the reception of an Assistance Data component, but before responding with an Assistance Data Acknowledgement or a Protocol Error component, the MS receives a new RRLP message with the Assistance Data component, it acts as follows:
-	if the old and new Assistance Data components have the same Reference Number and, if included, the same Extended Reference IE and if pseudo-segmentation does not apply (see sub-clause 2.5.9), the MS ignores the later component;
-	if the old and new Assistance Data components have different Reference Numbers or, if included, different Extended Reference IEs or if one Assistance Data component (old or new) contains an Extended Reference IE but the other component does not, the MS ignores the former component and sends an acknowledgement to the latter component.
When after the reception of a Positioning Capability Request component, but before responding with a Positioning Capability Response or a Protocol Error component, the MS receives a new RRLP message with the Positioning Capability Request component, it acts as follows:
-	if the old and new Positioning Capability Request components have the same Reference Number and the same Extended Reference IE, the MS ignores the later component;
-	if the old and new Positioning Capability Request components have different Reference Numbers or different Extended Reference IEs, the MS aborts activity for the former component, starts to act according to the later component and sends a response to that.
When after the reception of an Measure Position Response component, the SMLC receives a new RRLP message with the Measure Position Response component, it acts as follows:
-	if the old and new Measure Position Response components have the same Reference Number and, if included, the same Extended Reference IE values, the SMLC may ignore the later component;
2.5.6	(void)
2.5.7	Missing Component
When the SMLC sends a Measure Position Request component to the MS, it starts a timer. If the timer expires before the SMLC receives the last Measure Position Response component or a Protocol Error component from the MS with the same Reference Number and, if included, the same Extended Reference IE value as in the sent component, it may abort location attempt or send a new Measure Position Request.
When the SMLC receives a Measure Position Response component with the same Reference Number and, if included, the same Extended Reference IE value as in the sent component indicating that it is the second of many segments, but the first of the many segments was never received by the SMLC, it may abort location attempt or send a new Measure Position Request.
When the SMLC sends a Assistance Data component to the MS, it starts a timer. If the timer expires before the SMLC receives a Assistance Data Acknowledgement or Protocol Error component from the MS with the same Reference Number as in the sent component and, in the case of a Protocol Error component, either the same extended reference ID as in the sent component or no extended reference ID, it may abort delivery attempt or send a new Assistance Data. 
When the SMLC sends a Positioning Capability Request component to the MS, it starts a timer. If the timer expires before the SMLC receives a Positioning Capability Response or Protocol Error component from the MS with the same Reference Number and the same Extended Reference ID as in the sent component, it may abort the Positioning Capability Transfer Procedure attempt or send a new Positioning Capability Request.
2.5.8	Unforeseen Component
When the MS receives a complete Assistance Data pseudo-segmentation sequence or an Assistance Data component that was sent without pseudo-segmentation, that it is not expecting, MS may discard it.
2.5.8a		RRLP Procedure
The MS and SMLC shall only support one RRLP procedure at a time for either positioning, delivery of assistance data or positioning capability transfer. The normal sequence of events for either procedure is defined in sub-clause 2.2, sub-clause 2.3 or sub-clause2.3a, respectively. If the MS is engaged in an RRLP procedure and receives a correctly encoded RRLP message from the SMLC that starts a new procedure, the MS shall abort the first procedure without sending a response and start the second.
2.5.9		Pseudo-Segmentation
When the SMLC employs pseudo-segmentation to send an RRLP Measure Position Request message or an RRLP Assistance Data message, the SMLC shall send one or more RRLP Assistance Data components followed by:
-	a final RRLP Measure Position Request component (see sub-clause 2.2) or
-	a final RRLP Assistance Data component (see sub-clause 2.3).
The SMLC shall indicate in all but the final component (Measure Position Request or Assistance Data, respectively) that more components are on the way.
When an MS receives an Assistance Data component indicating that more components are on the way, the MS may store the contents of the component. If the MS receives a subsequent Assistance Data component or a final Measure Position Request component that is correctly encoded, the MS shall assume that the new component continues the pseudo-segmentation of the earlier component and may then store the contents of the new component. If the new component is an Assistance Data component indicating that no more components are on the way or if it is a Measure Position Request, the MS shall assume that pseudo-segmentation is complete. The MS may then employ the rules defined in sub-clause 2.5.5 to verify if the new message is a repeated duplicate of a previous message.
2.6	Multilateration Timing Advance Procedure
The purpose of this procedure is to enable the SMLC to request an MS to perform the Multilateration Timing Advance procedure in multiple cells autonomously selected by the MS. The BSS(s) corresponding to the selected cells acquire and send timing advance related measurements to the SMLC which uses the received measurements to perform a location estimate for the MS. 

Figure 2.6: Multilateration Timing Advance procedure 
1.	The RRLP Multilateration Timing Advance Request component is sent to the MS (see step 1 in Figure 2.6). The RRLP message contains assistance information acquired from the serving BSS which can be used by the MS to perform the Multilateration Timing Advance procedure.
2.	The MS performs the Multilateration Timing Advance procedure in multiple cells that it selects autonomously which may include one or more cells for which it has received assistance information in the RRLP message (see steps 2a, 2b … 2n). After the MS performs the radio access part of the MTA procedure in a given cell the corresponding BSS sends the cell specific Multilateration timing advance information to the SMLC.
3.	The SMLC uses the collected timing advance information to estimate a “position” for the MS (see step 3).

3	Message Structure
3.1	General Format of RRLP Message
The general format of the RRLP message is given below, and based on:
-	ITU-T Recommendation X.680;
-	ITU-T Recommendation X.691;
and is consistent with these ITU-T recommendations. Also further definitions in the present document are based on ASN.1/94 defined in ITU-T Recommendation X.680 (ASN.1 1994). BASIC-PER, unaligned variant is used. Both RRLP ASN.1 modules, RRLP-Messages and RRLP-Components, are based on recommendations presented above.
ASN.1 identifiers have the same name as the corresponding parameters (information elements of the RRLP message, components, elements of components, fields of component elements etc) in other parts of the present document, except for the differences required by the ASN.1 notation (blanks between words are removed, the first letter of the first word is lower-case and the first letter of the following words are capitalized, e.g. "Reference Number" is mapped to "referenceNumber"). In addition some words may be abbreviated as follows:
msr	measure
req	request
rsp 	response
nbr	number
ack 	acknowledgement
Ellipsis Notation shall be used in the same way as described in 3GPP TS 29.002 and shall be supported on the radio interface by the MS and the network for all operations defined in the present document.

The message consists of two information elements, that are further described in the following sub-clauses.
3.2	Reference Number IE
This element is mandatory, and appears only once per RRLP message. It has the range from 0 to 7. Value 0 is reserved for indicating unknown Reference Number. Its ASN.1 definition is in sub-clause 3.1. This element contains the Reference Number that shall be used as follows:
-	in the Position Measurement procedure the SMLC shall select any number within the range 1- 7 that it is not already using with the particular MS. The Reference Number serves as an identification of the Measure Position request component that it sends to the MS. When the MS responds either with the Measure Position Response component, or the Protocol Error component, it shall use the same Reference Number value and, if an Extended Reference ID was included by the SMLC, the same Extended Reference ID to identify to which Measure Position Request it is responding, if the Reference Number has been obtained. If the MS has not been able to decode the Reference Number (e.g. IE missing), it shall use '0' as the Reference number in the response. This mechanism helps for example in the cases where the SMLC sends a Measure Position Request to the MS, and before it receives the Response, it needs to send another Request (e.g. assistance data changes). Then the SMLC can identify to which Request the Response is related to;
-	in the Assistance Data Delivery procedure the SMLC shall select any number within the range 1 - 7 that it is not already using with the MS. The Reference Number serves as an identification of the Assistance Data component that it sends to the MS. When the MS responds either with the Assistance Data Acknowledgement component or the Protocol Error component, it shall use the same Reference Number value if the Reference Number has been obtained and, in the case of Protocol Error, if an Extended Reference ID was included by the SMLC, the same Extended Reference ID to identify to which Assistance Data component it is responding. If the MS has not been able to decode the Reference Number (e.g. IE missing), it shall use '0' as the Reference number in the response.
-	in the Position Capability Transfer procedure the SMLC shall select any number within the range 1 - 7 that it is not already using with the MS. The Reference Number serves as an identification of the Positioning Capability Request component that it sends to the MS. When the MS responds either with the Positioning Capability Response component, or the Protocol Error component, it shall use the same Reference Number value if the Reference Number has been obtained and the same Extended Reference ID value if that has been obtained to identify to which Positioning Capability Request component it is responding. If the MS has not been able to decode the Reference Number (e.g. IE missing), it shall use '0' as the Reference number in the response.
-	the SMLC shall use the same Reference Number and same Extended Reference ID to resend any RRLP component for which a response was not received from the MS.
-	the SMLC shall use a different Reference Number to that in any RRLP component for which a response was not received from the MS if the SMLC aborts an existing RRLP procedure and starts a new procedure. 
-	the SMLC may use the same Reference Number and same Extended Reference ID or different Reference Numbers and Extended Reference IDs for different RRLP components within the same pseudo-segmentation sequence.
In all RRLP messages except Assistance Data Acknowledgement, the Reference Number IE shall be supplemented by an Extended Reference IE in order to distinguish valid from invalid RRLP responses at the SMLC and duplicate from non-duplicate RRLP commands at the MS. In order to remain backward compatible, the receiving entity shall be able to receive Measure Position Request, Measure Position Response, Assistance Data and Protocol Error messages without the Extended Reference IE. The ASN.1 definition of the Extended Reference IE is given in sub-clause 5.1 and the procedures associated with sending and receiving it are given in clause 2 and in Annex A, sub-clauses A.2.2.5, A.3.2.7 and A.6.6.
3.3	Component IE
This element is mandatory, and appears only once per RRLP message. It contains the actual component to be transferred.
Different components are described further in Chapter 4. This IE contains only one component, i.e. it is not possible to include two or more components.
4	Components

Description of Components
A.1	Introduction
This annex describes the contents of components.
A.2	Measure Position Request
A.2.1	General
The Measure Position Request is a RRLP component from the SMLC to the MS. This component is common to E-OTD,GPS and GANSS (Galileo and Additional Navigation Satellite Systems) location methods. As a response to this component, the MS performs E-OTD,GPS or GANSS measurements and possibly calculates its own position, if the MS and/or the network support these options. It contains the following elements.

This field indicates whether MS based or assisted version is allowed/requested. If the Positioning Methods field includes more than one method, the Method Type applies to all of them. This field is mandatory, and has the following values:
'0': MS assisted;
'1': MS based;
'2': MS based is preferred, but MS assisted is allowed;
'3': MS assisted is preferred, but MS based is allowed.
In GPS positioning methods, 'MS based' may indicate either MS Based Assisted GPS method or Conventional GPS method. If 'MS based is indicated with no GPS assistance data then the MS may interpret this as either Conventional GPS or MS based A-GPS without assistance data. The same interpretation applies also to the GANSS positioning method.
Positioning Methods
This field indicates which location method or methods should be used. This field is mandatory.
'0': E-OTD;
'1': GPS;
'2': E-OTD or GPS (i.e. both can be reported).
NOTE:	If the selected positioning method is 'GPS' or 'E-OTD or GPS', the field GANSS Positioning Method, if present in a Measure Position Request component, indicates request of GANSS method and indicates the allowed satellite systems.
Response Time
This field indicates the desired response time. However, when performing measurements, the desired response time may be exceeded. This field is mandatory.
The response time is 2N seconds, where N is the value in this field. Thus the desired maximum response time can be 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, or 128 seconds.
Range: 	0-7
Accuracy
This field indicates the required accuracy of the location estimate. This is field is mandatory when Method Type is '1', '2', or '3' and optional when Method Type is '0'.
This field is 7 bit Uncertainty Code as defined in 3GPP TS 23.032.
Multiple Sets
This field indicates whether MS is requested to send multiple E-OTD/GPS/GANSS Measurement Information Sets. The maximum number of measurement sets is three. This is field is mandatory. MS is expected to include the current measurement set. Additionally MS may include historical measurement sets, or measure new additional sets if the response time allows that.
'0': 	multiple IEs can be send;
'1': 	sending of multiple sets is not allowed.
Environment Characterization
Environment Characterization field provides the MS with information about expected multipath and NLOS in the current area. This field is optional.
'0':	possibly heavy multipath and NLOS conditions (e.g. bad urban or urban).
'1':	no or light multipath and usually LOS conditions (e.g. suburban or rural).
'2':	not defined or mixed environment.
'3':	reserved for future use.
A.2.2.1a	GANSS Positioning Method Element
This bit map indicates the satellite systems allowed by the SMLC corresponding to allowance of 'GPS' in the Positioning Methods field. Each bit is of type Boolean, where TRUE ('1') means the particular satellite system is allowed. For example EOTD + Galileo method can be indicated by setting 'E-OTD or GPS' in Positioning Methods and setting only the 'bit 1' to TRUE value in the GANSS Positioning Method element. The MS shall not request assistance data or report measurements for the systems that are not indicated in the bit map.
NOTE:	Bit 0 of this bit map shall not be the only one set to TRUE ('1').
'bit 0': 	GPS;
'bit 1': 	Galileo; 
'bit 2':	SBAS (WAAS, EGNOS, MSAS, GAGAN);
'bit 3':	Modernized GPS (L1C, L2C, L5);
'bit 4':	QZSS;

A.2.2.2	E-OTD Reference BTS for Assistance Data Element
The RTD and 51 multiframe offset values in the E-OTD Measurement Assistance Data element and the E-OTD Measurement Assistance Data for System Information List element are calculated relative to the BTS indicated in this element. Also the E-OTD Measurement Assistance data for System Information List element, if present, refers to the System Information Neighbor List of this reference BTS.
Inclusion of this parameter is mandatory for E-OTD since it is not possible to reliably default to the current serving BTS for the target MS, as there is a small chance that the SMLC does not know this. If the E-OTD Measurement Assistance data for System Information List element is present, the current serving cell must be the same as reference BTS identified in this element.
BCCH Carrier
This field indicates the absolute RF channel number of BCCH of the reference BTS. This field is mandatory.
Range: 	0 - 1023
BSIC
This field indicates the BSIC (Base Station Identity Code) of the reference BTS. This field is mandatory.
Range: 	0 - 63
Time Slot Scheme
The Time Slot Scheme field indicates the type of transmission scheme the reference BTS is using. If the MS measures BTSs signals from time slots other than 0 or 4, and it is informed about the burst length schemes used by BTSs, then it can compensate for the possible error. (This is necessary if the MS averages bursts from different time slots, and the BTS uses varying lengths of bursts.) This field is mandatory.
'0' = all time slots are 156,25 bits long.
'1' = time slots 0 and 4 are 157 bits long and other time slots are 156 bits long.
BTS Position
This field contains the BTS position in the format defined in 3GPP TS 23.032. This field is optional, but should be present for MS based E-OTD positioning. The allowed shapes are:
-	ellipsoid point;
-	ellipsoid point with altitude and uncertainty ellipsoid.
A.2.2.3	E-OTD Measurement Assistance Data Element
This element identifies BTSs that are used for E-OTD measurements. This element helps the MS to make measurements from neighbor BTS (even below decoding level). This element is optional in the Measure Position Request component. The presence of this element means that the MS should try to measure the E-OTD values between the reference BTS and the BTSs identified in this element.
This element is used to deliver E-OTD measurement assistance data for those BTSs, that are not included in the System Information Neighbor List of the reference BTS, if necessary.
The RTD and 51 multiframe offset values are calculated relative to the BTS indicated in the E-OTD Reference BTS for Assistance Data element. This element contains the following fields.
Number of BTSs
This field indicates how many BTSs are included in this IE. This field is mandatory. The maximum number of BTSs in this message for whom the assistance data can be given is 16 (reference BTS and 15 neigbour BTSs). Thus the sum of Number of BTSs field in this IE and total amount of E-OTD Neighbor present bits with value '1' in E-OTD Measurement Assistance Data for System Information List IE can be at a maximum 15.
Range: 	1 to 15.
The following fields are repeated for the number of BTSs included in the Number of BTSs field.

The multiframe offset is defined as TBTS - TRef, where TBTS is the time of the start of the 51 multiframe in the BTS in question, and TRef is the time of the start of the 51 multiframe in the reference BTS. This field is mandatory. Multiframe Offset may be used to calculate the Expected Multiframe Offset (the Multiframe Offset value that MS is expected to measure between this BTS and reference BTS in its current estimated location).
Expected Multiframe Offset = (Multiframe Offset + Adjustment) modulo 51
Adjustment =	1 if Rough RTD - Expected OTD >= 850
Adjustment =	-1 if Rough RTD - Expected OTD =< -850
Adjustment =	0 if -400 =< Rough RTD - Expected OTD =< 400
If the Rough RTD - Expected OTD is not within any of the ranges above, an error has occurred and the Expected OTD should be ignored and no Expected Multiframe Offset can be calculated.
Range:	0 - 51
Usable range of Multiframe Offset value is 0 - 50. The Multiframe Offset value 51 shall not be encoded by the transmitting entity and shall be treated by the receiving entity as 0.
Time Slot Scheme
The Time Slot Scheme field indicates the type of transmission scheme the particular BTS is using. If the MS measures BTSs signals from time slots other than 0 or 4, and it is informed about the burst length schemes used by BTSs, then it can compensate for the possible error. (This is necessary if the MS averages bursts from different time slots, and the BTS uses varying lengths of bursts.) This field is mandatory.

'1' = time slots 0 and 4 are 157 bits long and other time slots are 156 bits long.
Rough RTD
This field indicates the rough RTD value between this BTS and reference BTS. The used resolution is 1 bits.

Accurate RTD values are needed for MS based E-OTD, i.e. when the MS calculates its own position.
Expected OTD
This field indicates the OTD value that MS is expected to measure between this BTS and reference BTS in its current estimated location. SMLC can estimate MS's location roughly e.g. based on serving BTS coordinates, TA, and possibly some other information. The used resolution is 1 bits. This OTD value is the OTD value of TS0s (i.e. the difference in starting of TS0), not only the OTD between starts of bursts. The OTD is defined as TBTS - TRef, where TBTS is the time of the start of TS0 in the BTS in question, and TRef is the time of the start of the TS0 in the reference BTS. This is element is Release 98 extension and it is an optional element included in Release98-Ext IE. SMLC shall send this element to MS supporting MS Assisted or MS Based E-OTD.
Range:	0 - 1250
Usable range of Expected OTD value is 0 - 1249. The Expected OTD value 1250 shall not be encoded by the transmitting entity and shall be treated by the receiving entity as 0.
Uncertainty Of Expected OTD
This field indicates the uncertainty in Expected OTD value. The uncertainty is related to SMLC's estimation of MS's location. The uncertainty defines following search window for MS, that it can use to speed up the OTD measurements:
	Expected OTD - Uncertainty < measured OTD < Expected OTD + Uncertainty.
This is element is Release 98 extension and it is an optional element included in Release98-Ext IE. SMLC shall send this element to MS supporting MS Assisted or MS Based E-OTD.

'4'	12 < uncertainty <= 16 bit;
'5'	16 < uncertainty <= 22 bit;
'6'	22 < uncertainty <= 30 bit;
'7'	uncertainty > 30 bit.
NOTE:	If uncertainty in MS's location is x bits, uncertainty in Expected OTD is 2*x (in the worst case). When the uncertainty is given with value '7' no upper bound exist for the uncertainty.
The following fields tell the coordinates of neighbor BTSs that are used for E-OTD measurements, and also fine RTD values. This information allows the MS to calculate its own location. These fields (Fine RTD, Relative north, Relative east and Relative altitude) are optional. All of Fine RTD, Relative north, and Relative east fields must be present, if some of them is included.
Fine RTD
This field indicates the fine RTD value between this BTS and reference BTS. It provides the 1/256 bit duration resolution to the value expressed in the corresponding Rough RTD field. This RTD value is the RTD value of TS0s (i.e. the difference in starting of TS0), not only the RTD between starts of bursts. The RTD is defined as TBTS - TRef, where TBTS is the time of the start of TS0 in the BTS in question, and TRef is the time of the start of the TS0 in the reference BTS. This field is optional.

The System Information Neighbor Lists, to which this assistance data is given, are System Information Neighbor Lists that are sent in the dedicated mode, packet idle mode, packet transfer mode, or dual transfer mode. This element helps the MS to make measurements from those neighbor BTS (even below decoding level). This element is optional in the Measure Position Request component. The presence of this element means that the MS should use the BTSs identified here to the E-OTD measurements.
The RTD and 51 multiframe offset values are calculated relative to the reference BTS. This element contains the following fields.

This field is mandatory. Multiframe Offset may be used to calculate the Expected Multiframe Offset (the Multiframe Offset value that MS is expected to measure between this BTS and reference BTS in its current estimated location).
	Expected Multiframe Offset = (Multiframe Offset + Adjustment) modulo 51

A.2.2.4a	GPS Time Assistance Measurement Request element 
This component does not have any information contents. If this component is present, the MS is requested to return GPS time assistance measurements. 
A.2.2.4b 	GPS Reference Time Uncertainty element
This element provides the accuracy of the relation GPS and GSM time in the Reference Time field in GPS Assistance Data IE. If GPS TOW is the given GPS time, then the true GPS time, corresponding to the provided GSM time as observed at the MS location, lies in the interval (GPS TOW - GPS Reference Time Uncertainty, GPS TOW + GPS Reference Time Uncertainty). An entity that supports this element shall always include it when appropriate. This means that when the element is expected but is not received, lack of support at the sender can be assumed and some implementation dependent default interpretation can then be applied.
The uncertainty r, expressed in microseconds, is mapped to a number K, with the following formula:
	r = C*(((1+x)K)-1)
with C = 0,0022 and x = 0,18. With 0 £ K £ 127, a suitably useful range between 0 and 3 second is achieved for the uncertainty, while still being able to code down to values as small as 0,3 nanoseconds. To encode any higher value of uncertainty than that corresponding in the above formula to K=127, the same value, K=127, shall also be used. The uncertainty is then coded on 7 bits, as the binary encoding of K.

A.2.2.4c	Velocity Request element
If this element is present, the MS is requested to return a velocity estimate along with the location estimate. Requesting velocity does not guarantee its delivery, if conditions support its availability and it is requested it will be provided.

This component does not have any information contents. If this component is present, the MS is requested to return carrier phase measurements in the GANSS Measurement Information IE.
A.2.2.4e	GANSS TOD - GSM Time Association Request Element 
This component does not have any information contents. If this component is present, the MS is requested to return GANSS TOD - GSM time association measurements. Only either GPS Timing Assistance Measurement Request Element or GANSS TOD - GSM Time Association Measurement Request should be present in Measure Position Request.
A.2.2.4f	Required Response Time
This element indicates the maximum response time that shall be allowed for the positioning request in the MS. When this element is received, the MS shall send an RRLP Measure Position Response before the required response time has elapsed. 
When this element is received, the MS shall ignore the Response Time field in the Positioning Instructions element.
The Required Response Time has a value from 1 to 128 seconds.
A.2.2.4g	GANSS Multi-frequency Measurement Request Element 
This component does not have any information contents.
If this component is present, the MS is requested to return measurements performed on multiple GANSS signal types if the MS supports this capability. If this component is not present, the MS shall report only one signal type for each GANSS.
If SMLC has indicated supported signal types in Positioning Capability Request, the MS shall only report signals that are supported by SMLC.
A.2.2.5	Extended Reference IE
This element is mandatory in any RRLP Measure Position Request component, any RRLP Assistance Data component, any RRLP Positioning Capability Request component and any RRLP Positioning Capability response component.
NOTE:	For reasons of backward compatibility, the IE is not defined for a Release 4 or earlier SMLC and would be ignored, when received, by a Release 4 or earlier MS. Additionally, other requirements associated with this IE would not be supported by a Release 4 or earlier MS or SMLC.
The Extended Reference IE contains the following elements:
SMLC code:	an integer in the range 0-63 distinguishing any SMLC from other neighbour SMLCs in the same Routing Area. Each SMLC is assigned a specific SMLC ID value. The values assigned to neighbour SMLCs in the same Routing Area between which inter-NSE cell change is possible should be different.
Transaction ID:	an integer in the range 0-262143 distinguishing different RRLP transactions in different MSs currently being served by the same SMLC. An SMLC shall assign a different transaction ID to each currently open RRLP transaction for positioning and assistance data delivery among all target MSs. When any RRLP transaction for any MS is completed in the SMLC (e.g. the MS has sent a correctly formatted RRLP Measure Position Response or Assistance Data Ack.) or if the transaction is aborted (e.g. SMLC timeout on an RRLP response), the associated transaction ID value shall become free and may be later assigned to a new RRLP transaction by the SMLC. When any transaction ID value becomes free, an SMLC should attempt to wait for at least 128 seconds (the maximum defined RRLP response time from an MS) before reassigning the same value.
A.3	Measure Position Response

Reference Frame MSB
This field shall be included when GPS-GSM time association is provided for either MS Based A-GPS or MS Assisted A-GPS. It indicates the Most Significant Bits (MSBs) of the frame number of the reference BTS corresponding to the GPS measurement or location estimate. Starting from the complete GSM frame number denoted FN, the MS calculates Reference Frame MSB as

This field together with the GPS TOW field in the Location Information Element provides a more accurate time stamp of the location estimate for MS based AGPS Expressed in units of microseconds. The precise GPS time of measurements in milliseconds is thus equal to 
	GPS TOW + 0,0001*GPS TOW Subms 
The estimation of precise GPS time of measurement using AGPS is vulnerable to millisecond ambiguities. Therefore the MS shall only report this field when it is confident that any millisecond ambiguities have been avoided.

where fix() denotes rounding to the nearest integer towards zero. The estimation of tsv_1 which forms the basis for the calculation of Delta TOW is vulnerable to millisecond ambiguities. Therefore the MS shall only report this field when it is confident that the correct millisecond event has been recovered.
Range: 	0-127

When an MS employs pseudo-segmentation to return an RRLP response, the same Extended Reference IE shall be included in each RRLP Measure Position Response component.
A.3.2.8	Uplink RRLP Pseudo Segmentation Indication
This element is included by the MS when up-link RRLP pseudo-segmentation is used. In the first segment, 'first of many' is indicated and in the second 'second of many' is indicated. It is not included when up-link pseudo-segmentation is not used.

GANSS TOD Uncertainty
This parameter provides the accuracy of the relation between GANSS TOD and GSM time if GANSS TOD- GSM time association is provided. When GANSS TOD-GSM time association is not provided, this element can be included to provide the accuracy of the reported GANSS TOD.
The uncertainty r, expressed in microseconds, is mapped to a number K, with the following formula:
	r = C*(((1+x)K)-1)
with C = 0,0022 and x = 0,18. With 0 £ K £ 127, a suitably useful range between 0 and 3 second is achieved for the uncertainty, while still being able to code down to values as small as 0,3 nanoseconds. To encode any higher value of uncertainty than that corresponding in the above formula to K=127, the same value, K=127, shall also be used. The uncertainty is then coded on 7 bits, as the binary encoding of K.

A.3.2.10	GANSS Measurement Information Element
The purpose of the GANSS Measurement Information element is to provide GANSS measurement information from the MS to the SMLC and GANSS TOD - GSM time association if requested by the SMLC. This information includes the measurements of code phase, Doppler, C/No and optionally accumulated carrier phase, also called accumulated deltarange (ADR), which enable the network-based GANSS method where position is computed in the SMLC. The contents are shown in table A.10.7, and the individual fields are described subsequently. See also Figure A.1a for an illustration of the relation between some of the fields.

Figure A.1a. Exemplary definitions of GANSS measurement information fields.
GANSS Measurement Information element is included in the Measure Position Response component if the network has requested the mobile to perform mobile-assisted location measurements using GANSS Positioning Method. GANSS Measurement Information element will also optionally include carrier phase measurements if SMLC has requested the MS to perform carrier phase measurements.
The following fields are repeated the number of times indicated in Number of E-OTD/GPS/GANSS Measurement Sets field if Multiple Sets element is included. If Multiple Sets element is not included, the default value for sets is one (i.e. the following fields are present only once).

Reference Frame 
These fields are shown in Table A.10.8 and are optional, but shall be included when GANSS TOD- GSM time association is provided.
Note that expected values for Reference FN are in range 0 - 42431. The time of the reference frame boundary is as observed by the MS, ie without Timing Advance compensation. 
Reference FN MSB field indicates the Most Significant Bits (MSB) of the frame number of the reference BTS corresponding to the GANSS Measurement Information. 
Starting from the complete GSM frame number denoted FN, the MS calculates Reference FN MSB as
	Reference FN MSB = floor(FN/42432)
The complete GSM frame number FN can then be reconstructed in the SMLC by combining the fields Reference Frame with Reference FN MSB in the following way
	FN = Reference FN MSB*42432+Reference FN

GANSS TOD
This field specifies the GANSS TOD for which the GANSS Measurement Parameters in GANSS Generic Measurement Information Element are valid. This field shall be included when GANSS TOD-GSM time association is provided or if GPS Measurement Information element is not present in a Measure Position Response component. If GPS Measurement Information element is present in a Measure Position Response component, and GANSS TOD field is absent in the GANSS Measurement Information element, the GPS TOW included in the GPS Measurement Information element specifies the reference time for which the GANSS Measurement Parameters are valid.
The 22 bits of GANSS TOD are the least significant bits. The most significant bits shall be derived by the Serving Mobile Location Centre to unambiguously derive the GANSS TOD.
The value for GANSS TOD is derived from the GNSS specific system time of the GNSS reported first in the GANSS Measurement IE rounded down to the nearest millisecond unit.

DeltaTOD
This field specifies the difference in milliseconds between GANSS TOD reported in the GANSS Measurement Information Element and the millisecond part of the SV time tsv_1 of the first SV in the list reported from the MS. The DeltaTOD is defined as 
DeltaTOD = GANSS TOD - fix(tsv_1)
where fix() denotes rounding to the nearest integer towards zero.
Range: 	0-127
GANSS TOD Uncertainty
This element provides the accuracy of the relation GANSS TOD -GSM time when GANSS TOD-GSM time association is provided. When GANSS TOD-GSM time association is not provided, even if GANSS TOD - GSM Time Association Measurement Request is not included in the Measure Position Request, this element can be included to provide the accuracy of the reported GANSS TOD. 
If GANSS TOD is the given GNSS time, then the true GNSS time, corresponding to the provided GSM time as observed at the MS location, lies in the interval (GANSS TOD – GANSS TOD Uncertainty, GANSS TOD + GANSS TOD Uncertainty).
The uncertainty r, expressed in microseconds, is mapped to a number K, with the following formula:
	r = C*(((1+x)K)-1)
with C = 0,0022 and x = 0,18. With 0 £ K £ 127, a suitably useful range between 0 and 3 second is achieved for the uncertainty, while still being able to code down to values as small as 0,3 nanoseconds. To encode any higher value of uncertainty than that corresponding in the above formula to K=127, the same value, K=127, shall also be used. The uncertainty is then coded on 7 bits, as the binary encoding of K.

Code Phase
This field contains the whole and fractional value of the code-phase measurement made by the MS for the particular satellite signal at the time of measurement in the units of ms. GNSS specific code phase measurements (e.g. chips) are converted into unit of ms by dividing the measurements by the nominal values of the measured signal chipping rate (e.g. Galileo L1 OS measurement is divided by 1023,0 chip/ms).

The value of the ambiguity is given in the GANSS Ambiguity field of the GANSS Generic Measurement Information element.
The Integer code phase is optional. The default value is 0.
Code Phase RMS Error
This field contains Code Phase RMS Error value. This parameter has the same range as described in Table A.10.
Doppler
This field contains the Doppler measured by the MS for the particular satellite signal. This information can be used to compute the 3-D velocity of the MS. 
The Doppler range is sufficient to cover the potential range of values measured by the MS. Doppler measurements are converted into unit of m/s by multiplying the Doppler measurement in Hz by the nominal wavelength of the measured signal.
ADR
This field contains the ADR measurement measured by the MS for the particular satellite signal. This information can be used to compute the 3-D velocity or high-accuracy position of the MS. ADR measurements are converted into units of m by multiplying the ADR measurement by the nominal wavelength of the measured signal.
This field is optional and shall be included only when carrier phase measurements are requested.

This element is conditional. It is as described in sub-clause 2.2.5. If the network can provide assistance data, and data for E-OTD has been requested, this element is included.
A.4.2.4	GPS Assistance Data Element
The GPS Assistance Data element contains a single GPS assistance message that supports both MS-assisted and MS-based GPS methods. This element can contain one or more of the fields listed in table A.12 below, which support both MS-assisted and MS-based GPS methods. As table A.12 shows, all fields are optional.
Note that certain types of GPS Assistance data may be derived, wholly or partially, from other types of GPS Assistance data.
In addition, an Integrity Monitor (IM) shall detect unhealthy (e.g., failed/failing) satellites and also shall inform users of measurement quality in DGPS modes when satellites are healthy. Excessively large pseudo range errors, as evidenced by the magnitude of the corresponding DGPS correction, shall be used to detect failed satellites. Unhealthy satellites should be detected within 10 seconds of the occurrence of the satellite failure. When unhealthy (e.g., failed/failing) satellites are detected, the assistance and/or DGPS correction data shall not be supplied for these satellites. When the error in the IM computed position is excessive for solutions based upon healthy satellites only, DGPS users shall be informed of measurement quality through the supplied UDRE values. After bad satellites have been indicated in the Real Time Integrity field, if the satellites return to healthy condition for some period of time, the indications for them shall be removed from this field.

When RRLP pseudo-segmentation is used, Table A.12 indicates which parameters may be repeated in more than one RRLP segment in order to provide data for multiple satellites. When any such parameter appears in more than one segment, the following rules shall apply.
1.	There shall be no repetition of data for the same satellite.
2.	Optional and conditional elements in the parameter not associated with a particular satellite shall each appear in at most one RRLP segment.
3.	Any mandatory element not associated with a particular satellite shall assume consistent values in the case of an element related to current GPS time and the same value otherwise.
4.	The maximum number of satellites defined in sub-clause 5.1 for which data can be included for any parameter in one RRLP segment shall apply also when counted over all RRLP segments.
Reference Time
These fields specify the relationship between GPS time and air-interface timing of the BTS transmission in the reference cell. These fields occur once per message; some are mandatory and some are conditional, as shown in table A.14. Note that Reference Time may also be present within the Acquisition Assistance parameter.

This field specifies the GPS week number of the assistance being provided. GPS Week eliminates one-week ambiguities from the time of the GPS assistance. This field is mandatory.
NOTE:	The number of 1024 week cycles since the GPS zero time-point is provided in the GPS Reference Time Extension in Table A.29u.
GPS TOW
The GPS TOW (time-of-week) is a mandatory field and is specified with 80 msec resolution. When GSM Time Present is "1", GPS TOW and BCCH/BSIC/FNm/TN/BN IEs provide a valid relationship between GPS and GSM time, as seen at the approximate location of the MS, ie the propagation delay from BTS to MS shall be compensated for by the SMLC. Depending on implementation, the relation between GPS and GSM time may have varying accuracy. Therefore, the uncertainty of the timing relation may be provided in the optional field GPS Reference Time Uncertainty. If the propagation delay from BTS to MS is not accurately known, the SMLC shall use the best available approximation of the propagation delay and take the corresponding delay uncertainty into account in the calculation of the field GPS Reference Time Uncertainty. When GSM Time Present is "0", GPS TOW is an estimate of current GPS time of week at time of reception of the RRLP segment containing this data by the MS. The SMLC should achieve an accuracy of +/- 3 seconds for this estimate including allowing for the transmission delay between SMLC and MS of the RRLP segment containing GPS TOW. Note that the MS should further compensate GPS TOW for the time between the reception of the segment containing GPS TOW and the time when the GPS TOW field is used. 
BCCH Carrier/BSIC/FNm/TN/BN
These fields specify the state of the GSM frame number, timeslot number, and bit number, respectively, of the reference BTS with the specified BCCH carrier and BSIC at the time that correspond to GPS TOW. The SMLC shall use the current serving BTS as the reference BTS. The frame number field is given modulo 221, i.e., the MSB of the GSM frame number is truncated. The MS shall interpret FNm as the most recent of the two possible frame numbers that FNm could represent. The target MS has the option of rejecting a GPS position request or GPS assistance data if the reference BTS is not the serving BTS.
GPS TOW Assist
This field contains several fields in the Telemetry (TLM) Word and Handover Word (HOW) that are currently being broadcast by the respective GPS satellites. Combining this information with GPS TOW enables the MS to know the entire 1,2-second (60-bit) pattern of TLM and HOW that is transmitted at the start of each six-second subframe by the particular GPS satellite. This field contains information for each of N_SAT satellites, and optional. The individual fields for each satellite in the message are shown in table A.15a.

The first six values in this field indicate valid differential corrections. When using the values described below, the "UDRE Scale Factor" value is applied to the UDRE values contained in the message. The purpose is to indicate an estimate in the amount of error in the corrections.
The value "110" indicates that the source of the differential corrections (e.g., reference station or external DGPS network) is currently not being monitored. The value "111" indicates that the corrections provided by the source are invalid, as judged by the source. In the later case, the message shall contain no corrections for individual satellites. Any MS that receives DGPS Corrections in a GPS Assistance Data IE shall contain the appropriate logic to properly interpret this condition and look for the next IE.
N_SAT
This field indicates the number of satellites for which differential corrections are available. Corrections for up to 16 satellites.
SatID
This field identifies the satellite for which the corrections are applicable. The values ranging from 0 to 63 represent satellite PRNs ranging from 1 to 64, respectively.
IODE
This IE is the sequence number for the ephemeris for the particular satellite. The MS can use this IE to determine if new ephemeris is used for calculating the corrections that are provided in the broadcast message. This eight-bit IE identifies a particular set of ephemeris data for a GPS satellite and may occupy the numerical range of [0, 255]. The transmitted IODE value will be different from any value transmitted by the GPS satellite during the preceding six hours. For more information about this field can be found from RTCM-SC104.
User Differential Range Error (UDRE)
This field provides an estimate of the uncertainty (1-) in the corrections for the particular satellite. The value in this field shall be multiplied by the UDRE Scale Factor in the common Corrections Status/Health field to determine the final UDRE estimate for the particular satellite. The meanings of the values for this field are described in table A.18.

01
1,0 m < UDRE  4,0 m
10
4,0 m < UDRE  8,0 m
11
8,0 m < UDRE

Each UDRE value shall be adjusted based on the operation of an Integrity Monitor (IM) function which exists at the network (SMLC, GPS server, or reference GPS receiver itself). Positioning errors derived at the IM which are excessive relative to DGPS expected accuracy levels shall be used to scale the UDRE values to produce consistency.
Pseudo-Range Correction (PRC)
This field indicates the correction to the pseudorange for the particular satellite at the GPS Reference Time, t0. The value of this field is given in meters (m) and the resolution is 0,32, as shown in table A.15 above. The method of calculating this field is described in [9].
If the SMLC has received a request for GPS assistance data from an MS which included a request for the navigation models and DGPS (i.e., bit D and E are set to one in 'Requested GPS Assistance Data, see 3GPP TS 49.031), the SMLC shall determine, for each satellite, if the navigation model stored by the MS is still suitable for use with DGPS corrections (also see navigation model update conditions right before Table A.19) and if so and if DGPS corrections are supported the SMLC should send DGPS corrections without including the navigation model.
The IODE value sent for a satellite shall always be the IODE value that corresponds to the navigation model for which the pseudo-range corrections are applicable.
The pseudo-range correction shall correspond to the available navigation model (the one already stored in and identified by the MS or the one included in the same procedure as the pseudo-range correction). The MS shall only use the PRC value when the IODE value received matches its available navigation model.
Pseudo-Range Rate Correction (RRC)
This field indicates the rate-of-change of the pseudorange correction for the particular satellite, using the satellite ephemeris identified by the IODE IE. The value of this field is given in meters per second (m/sec) and the resolution is 0,032, as shown in table A.15 above. For some time t1 > t0, the corrections for IODE are estimated by
	PRC(t1, IODE) = PRC(t0, IODE) + RRC(t0, IODE)(t1 - t0) ,
and the MS uses this to correct the pseudorange it measures at t1, PRm(t1, IODE), by
	PR(t1, IODE) = PRm(t1, IODE) + PRC(t1, IODE) .
The SMLC shall always send the RRC value that corresponds to the PRC value that it sends (see above for details). The MS shall only use the RRC value when the IODE value received matches its available navigation model.
Delta Pseudo-Range Correction 2 (Delta PRC2)
This IE is not used. The sender shall set it to zero and the receiver shall ignore it.
Delta Pseudo-Range Rate Correction 2 (Delta RRC2)
This IE is not used. The sender shall set it to zero and the receiver shall ignore it.
Delta Pseudo-Range Correction 3 (Delta PRC3)
This IE is not used. The sender shall set it to zero and the receiver shall ignore it.
Delta Pseudo-Range Rate Correction 3 (Delta RRC3)
This IE is not used. The sender shall set it to zero and the receiver shall ignore it.
Navigation Model
This set of fields contains information required to manage the transfer of precise navigation data to the GPS-capable MS. In response to a request from an MS for GPS assistance data, the SMLC shall determine whether to send the navigation model for a particular satellite to an MS based upon factors like the T-Toe limit specified by the MS and any request from the MS for DGPS (also see above). This information includes control bit fields as well as satellite ephemeris and clock corrections. The individual fields are given in Table A.19 below, and the conditions for their presence is discussed below.

Num_Sats_Total
This field specifies the number of satellites that are included in the provided Navigation Model. A range of 1-16 is available. This field is mandatory when the Navigation Model field is included in the message.
SatID
This field identifies the satellite for which the assistance is applicable. This value is the same as the PRN number provided in the navigation message transmitted by the particular satellite. The range is 0 to 63, with 0-31 indicating GPS satellites 1-32, respectively, and 32-63 indicating satellites in future augmentation systems (e.g., WAAS or EGNOS). This field is mandatory for each included satellite.
Satellite Status
This field is a two-bit value that indicates the status of the Navigation Model for the particular satellite specified by SatID. This field is mandatory for each included satellite. The MS shall interpret the combinations of the two bits as follows.

This Satellite Navigation Model and associated bit fields include the parameters that accurately model the orbit and clock state of the particular satellite. For the particular satellite, these fields are conditional based on the value of Satellite Status for that satellite. The fields are absent when Satellite Status is "01", and present for all other values. The format for the ephemeris, clock corrections, and associate bits are specified in ICD-GPS-200.
Ionospheric Model
The Ionospheric Model contains fields needed to model the propagation delays of the GPS signals through the ionosphere. The information elements in this field are shown in table A.21. Proper use of these fields allows a single‑frequency GPS receiver to remove approximately 50 % of the ionospheric delay from the range measurements. The Ionospheric Model is valid for the entire constellation and changes slowly relative to the Navigation Model. All of the fields must be included when Ionospheric Model is present.

Almanac
These fields specify the coarse, long-term model of the satellite positions and clocks. These fields are given in table A.23. With one exception (i), these parameters are a subset of the ephemeris and clock correction parameters in the Navigation Model, although with reduced resolution and accuracy. The almanac model is useful for receiver tasks that require coarse accuracy, such as determining satellite visibility. The model is valid for up to one year, typically. Since it is a long-term model, the field should be provided for all satellites in the GPS constellation. If almanac is not provided for the full GPS constellation, the SMLC shall set the Complete Almanac Provided  field in Table A.29w to FALSE. All fields in the Almanac are mandatory when the Almanac is present. The fields toa and WNa specify the GPS time-of-week and week number, respectively, that are the reference points for the Almanac parameters.
The Almanac also is useful as an acquisition aid for network-based GPS methods. Given a recent Almanac (< 3‑4 weeks old), the MS only needs Reference Time and Reference Location information to quickly acquire the signals and return measurements to the network.
The Almanac also contains information about the health of that satellite as described in ICD-GPS-200. If this Alamanc has been captured from the satellite signal, the SV Health field represents the predicted satellite health at the time the GPS control segment uploaded the Almanac to the satellite. According to ICD-GPS-200, this health information may differ from the SV Health field in the Navigation Model (table A.19) due to different upload times.
The parameters Num_Sats_Total and SatID shall be interpreted in the same manner as described under table A19.

Acquisition Assistance
The Acquisition Assistance field of the GPS Assistance Data Information Element contains parameters that enable fast acquisition of the GPS signals in network-based GPS positioning. Essentially, these parameters describe the range and derivatives from respective satellites to the Reference Location at the Reference Time. Table A.24 illustrates the assistance data occurring once per message and table A.25 illustrates the assistance data occurring per number of satellites for which acquisition assistance is being provided. Figure A.2 illustrates the relation between some of the fields.
This field is optional. The field would probably appear when the Method Type field of the Positioning Instructions IE is set to 0 (MS-Assisted) and the Positioning Methods field of the Position Instructions IE is set to 1 (GPS) or 2 (GPS or E-OTD).

This field indicates whether or not angle information is present in this message. The MS shall interpret a value of "1" to mean that angle (Azimuth and Elevation) information is present, and "0" to mean that it is not provided. This field is mandatory.
Number of Satellites
This field contains the number of satellites identified in this information element. This field is mandatory.
Range: 0 - 15
Reference Time
The Reference Time field of the GPS Acquisition Assistance Data IE specifies the relationship between GPS time and air-interface timing of the BTS transmission in the reference cell.
GPS TOW subfield specifies the GPS TOW for which the location estimate is valid. When the parameters BCCH Carrier/BSIC/Frame #/Timeslots #/Bit # are present, together with GPSTOW they provide a valid relationship between GPS and GSM time, as seen at the approximate location of the MS, ie the propagation delay from BTS to MS shall be compensated for by the SMLC. Depending on implementation, the relation between GPS and GSM time may have varying accuracy. The uncertainty of the timing relation may be provided in the optional field GPS Reference Time Uncertainty. If the propagation delay from BTS to MS is not accurately known, the SMLC shall use the best available approximation of the propagation delay and take the corresponding delay uncertainty into account in the calculation of the field GPS Reference Time Uncertainty. GPS TOW is mandatory when the GPS Acquisition Assistance Data Information Element is included. When the GSM time parameters are not present the GPS TOW is an estimate of current GPS time of week at time of reception of the RRLP segment containing the GPS TOW by the MS. The SMLC should achieve an accuracy of +/- 3 seconds for this estimate including allowing for the transmission delay between SMLC and MS of the RRLP segment containing GPS TOW. Note that the MS should further compensate GPS TOW for the time between the reception of the segment containing GPS TOW and the time when the GPS TOW field is used.
Range: 0 - 604799,92 sec
The BCCH Carrier # and BSIC subfields specify the reference cell for which GSM timing is provided. These subfields are optional when the GPS Acquisition Assistance Data Information Element is included. If included, the SMLC shall set the reference cell to the current serving cell. A target MS has the option of rejecting a GPS position request or GPS assistance data if the reference cell is not the serving cell.
The Frame # subfield specifies the GSM frame number of the BTS transmissions for the reference cell that occur at the given GPS TOW. This subfield is optional when the GPS Acquisition Assistance Data Information Element is included.
Range: 0 - 2097151
The Timeslots # subfield specifies the GSM timeslot of the BTS transmissions for the reference cell that occur at the given GPS TOW. This subfield is optional when the GPS Acquisition Assistance Data Information Element is included.
Range: 0 - 7
The Bit # subfield specifies the GSM and bit number of the BTS transmissions for the reference cell that occur at the given GPS TOW. This subfield is optional when the GPS Acquisition Assistance Data Information Element is included.
Range: 0 - 156
SVID/PRNID
This field identifies the particular satellite for which the measurement data is supplied. This value is the same as the PRN number provided in the navigation message transmitted by the particular satellite.
The range is 0 to 63, where SVID = PRNID - 1
Doppler (0th order term)
This field contains the Doppler (0th order term) value. A positive value defines the increase in satellite signal frequency due to velocity towards the MS. A negative value defines the decrease in satellite signal frequency due to velocity away from the MS. This field is mandatory.
Range: 5120 Hz to 5117,5 Hz
Doppler (1st order term)
This field contains the Doppler (1st order term) value. A positive value defines the rate of increase in satellite signal frequency due to acceleration towards the MS. A negative value defines the rate of decrease in satellite signal frequency due to acceleration away from the MS. This field is optional.
Range: -1,0 Hz to 0,5 Hz / s
Doppler Uncertainty
This field contains the Doppler uncertainty value. It is defined such that the Doppler experienced by a stationary MS is in the range "Doppler  Doppler Uncertainty" to "Doppler  Doppler Uncertainty". This field is optional. If Doppler Uncertainty (together with Doppler 1st order term) is omitted, the terminal shall interpret Doppler Uncertainty as greater than +/-200 Hz. If the Doppler Uncertainty Extension (Table A.29x) field is present, the MS that supports the Doppler Uncertainty Extension shall ignore this field.
Permitted Values: 12,5 Hz, 25 Hz, 50 Hz, 100 Hz, 200 Hz as encoded by an integer n in the range 0-4 according to the formula in Table A.25
Code Phase
This field contains code phase, in units of 1 GPS chip, in the range from 0 to 1022 GPS chips, where increasing binary values of the field signify increasing predicted pseudoranges, as seen by a receiver at the Reference Location at the time GPS TOW. The Reference Location would typically be an apriori estimate of the MS location. This field is mandatory.
Range: 0-1022 chips
Integer Code Phase
This field contains integer code phase, i.e. the number of the code periods that have elapsed since the latest GPS bit boundary, in units of C/A code period, as seen by a receiver at the Reference Location at the time GPS TOW. This field is mandatory.
Range: 0-19
GPS Bit Number
This field contains GPS bit number (expressed modulo 4) currently being transmitted at the time GPS TOW, as seen by a receiver at the Reference Location. This field is mandatory.
Range: 0-3
Code Phase Search Window
This field contains the code phase search window. The code phase search window accounts for the uncertainty in the estimated MS location but not any uncertainty in GPS TOW. It is defined such that the expected code phase is in the range "Code Phase - Code Phase Search Window" to "Code Phase + Code Phase Search Window". This field is mandatory.

Azimuth
This field together with the Azimuth LSB  included in Acquisition Assistance Extension  in Table A.29v contains the azimuth angle. An angle of x degrees means the satellite azimuth a is in the range (x  a < x+0,703125) degrees. This field is optional.
Range: 0 – 359,296875 degrees.
Elevation
This field together with the Elevation LSB included in Acquisition Assistance Extension  in Table A.29v contains the elevation angle. An angle of y degrees means the satellite elevation e is in the range (y  e < y+0,703125) degrees except for y = 89,296875 where the range is extended to include 90 degrees. This field is optional.
Range: 0 – 89,296875 degrees
Real-Time Integrity
The Real-Time Integrity field of the GPS Assistance Data Information Element contains parameters that describe the real-time status of the L1C/A signal in GPS constellation. Primarily intended for non-differential applications, the real-time integrity of the satellite constellation is of importance as there is no differential correction data by which the mobile can determine the soundness of each satellite signal. The Real-Time GPS Satellite Integrity data communicates the health of the L1C/A signal to the mobile in real-time. The format is shown in table A.29. The SMLC shall always transmit the Real Time Integrity field with the current list of satellites with unhealthy L1C/A signal, for any A-GPS positioning attempt and whenever A-GPS assistance data is sent. The same applies for GANSS positioning attempt and assistance data when modernized GPS is involved. If the number of bad satellites (NBS) is zero, then the Real Time Integrity field shall be omitted. When the Extended Reference IE is included in the RRLP Measure Position Request message or in the RRLP Assistance Data message, then the MS shall interpret the absence of a Real Time Integrity field in the assistance data provided by the SMLC to mean that NBS is zero. If the Extended Reference IE is not present, this interpretation applies when the assistance data is provided by the SMLC following a previous request of the MS for Real Time Integrity data.

Bad_SVID
This six bit field appears NBS times, and indicates the SVID of satellites which L1C/A signal should not be used for fix by the user at this time. The values ranging from 0 to 63 represent satellite PRNs ranging from 1 to 64, respectively. 
A.4.2.4a	GPS Time Assistance Measurement Request Element

This element is conditional and provides the accuracy of the relation GPS and GSM time in the Acquisition Assistance in GPS Assistance Data Element. The interval, range and treatment is as described in sub-clause 2.2.4b.
A.4.2.4c	Additional GPS Assistance Data
The Additional GPS Assistance Data Element contains additional GPS assistance data which are not included in the GPS Assistance Data Element. This element can contain one or more of the fields listed in Table A.29a below.

When RRLP pseudo-segmentation is used, Table A.29a indicates which parameters may be repeated in more than one RRLP segment in order to provide data for multiple satellites. When any such parameter appears in more than one segment, the following rules shall apply.
1.	There shall be no repetition of the same data for the same satellite, even though there might be multiple realizations of the IEs for the same satellite. For example, GPS Ephemeris Extension may occur multiple times for the same satellite, but with different data content.
2.	Optional and conditional elements in the parameter not associated with a particular satellite shall each appear in at most one RRLP segment.
3.	Any mandatory element not associated with a particular satellite shall assume consistent values in the case of an element related to current GPS time and the same value otherwise.
4.	The maximum number of satellites defined in sub-clause 5.1 for which data can be included for any parameter in one RRLP segment shall apply also when counted over all RRLP segments.
GPS Ephemeris Extension
The GPS Ephemeris extension contains parameters designed to extend the time of applicability of the Ephemeris terms by the continuous addition of the delta ephemeris terms to the respective terms of the referenced ephemeris.
This message can provide extension information for every satellite for many days into the future; doing so may create a large message, thus care must be taken to consider the transport bandwidth.  The SMLC can limit the duration of the extension to decrease the message size.  For example if the extension duration is limited to twelve hours the payload will be approximately 2,000 octets, for a typical 27 satellite constellation.

GPS Delta Element List
GPS Delta Element List is a list of GPS Ephemeris Delta Elements
GPS Ephemeris Delta Element
Each GPS Ephemeris Delta Element is encoded as an octet string of up to 47 octets. Each element is uniquely identified by the pair (seqNum, sv_ID) and it is defined as a structure as shown in table A.29.m. The MS should parse the octet string according to the fields specified in table A.29.m. Each element in table A.29.m but for seqNum and sv_ID should be treated as a signed integer.  The actual number of octets is determined by the size of the bit fields in the GPS_Ephemeris_Delta_Sizes table (table A.29.k).  Each set of up to 47 octets represents a single extension for a single satellite vehicle.  Each element encodes the satellite vehicle ID and the sequence number.  The sequence number specifies the order in which the individual ephemeris extension elements are assembled as time marches forward to create the next ephemeris.  The sequence number is the same for all satellite vehicle IDs for a particular update period.

(1)	The number of bits of each signed integer field is variable and it is indicated once for all numEphemerisDeltas by the structure ephemerisDeltasSizes.  When the ephemerisDeltaSizes field is not present, the values found in the columns "Default # Bits" shall be used.
(2)	The scale factor of each parameter is variable around the default scale factor. The variation for each field is indicated once for all numEphemerisDeltas by the structure ephemerisDeltasScales. For example, if the scale factor modifier for delta_omega has a value of 4, the scale factor for delta_omega is 24 * 2-31.  When the ephemerisDeltaScales is not used, the values found in the column "Default Scale" shall be used.
sequenceNum
This field indicates the order of the Ephemeris delta terms.  The ephemeris constructed for use in satellite positioning is built by adding the delta terms to the referenced GPS_Navigation Model in the order dictated by this sequence number.  The sequence number shall remain the same for each svID in an epoch of Ephemeris Deltas corresponding to a particular update interval.
svID
This field identifies the satellite ID within a particular sequenceNum or epoch.
These fields, with the exception of sequenceNum and svID, specify the deltas to be added to the existing Ephemeris to create a new Ephemeris suite that is extended from its predecessor by the time provided in the "validityPeriod" parameter.  To compute the time of ephemeris for the newly constructed ephemeris, validityPeriod is added to the preceding toe.  The ephemeris time of clock (toc) is set equal to the toe.
For each of the other ephemeris terms the corresponding delta ephemeris term is added in order to create the updated ephemeris.  The terms delta_M0, delta_i0, and delta_OMEGA0 of the delta ephemeris must be extrapolated prior to the addition of the delta terms as follows:

Where  is the WGS 84 value of the earth's gravitational constant for GPS user and is equal to 3,986005 * 1014 m3/sec2, and A(i) is the semi-major axis associated with this satellite's update.  The extrapolation of delta_M0, uses the prior set's sqrtA term to compute A(i) as the square of sqrtA(i).
delta_OMEGA0(i+1)  = delta_OMEGA0(i)  + delta_OMEGAdot(i) * dt
i0 (i+1) = i0(i) + Idot(i) * dt
Where dt is equal to the validity period * 3600.  The terms af0, and af1 from the GPS clock model must be extrapolated as follows:
af0(i+1) = af0(i) + af1(i)* dt + af2*dt2
af1(i+1) = af1(i) + 2 * af2(i) * dt
af2(i+1) = af2(i)
Where af0, af1, and af2 are the clock model terms as shown in table A.29.c
dt is equal to the validity period represented in seconds (validityPeriod * 3600) 
The following demonstrates the application of the ephemeris extension technique.  Assume the  validityPeriod = 5, representing: (5+1)  hours = 6 hours, and the GPS Navigation model for a particular satellite, identified by the reference IOD has a toe = 0 seconds.
The toe for sequenceNumber 1 is computed by adding the validityPeriod  to the initial toe of 0 as 0 + 6 hours =  0 + 21600 seconds.  The new ephemeris is constructed by adding the delta ephemeris terms from set 1 to the reference ephemeris creating the new ephemeris, which will be used for the next six hours.  For the five terms listed above (delta_M0, delta_i0, delta_OMEGA0, af0, and af1) the extrapolation described must occur prior to the addition of the delta term.
The next ephemeris computation will occur by adding the validityPeriod to the current toe of 21600 as: 21600 + 6 hours = 21600 + 21600 = 43200.  The ephemeris delta terms from set two are added to the ephemeris resulting from the prior addition to create the next ephemeris.  This is done for each satellite vehicle ID.
GPS Ephemeris Extension check
The GPS Ephemeris Extension check provides information about non foreseen events that occurred during the period starting at the gpsBeginTime to the current time. An event is signified through a bit string . Each bits refers to one PRN. If a bit is set to one, this means that the ephemeris extension is no longer valid for this specific PRN.  In order to indicate planned future manuvers an end time is provided.  The SMLC can indicate that a future event is planned between the current time and the end time of this ephemeris extension.

When RRLP pseudo-segmentation is used, Tables A.30, A.31 and A.39 indicate which elements may be repeated in more than one RRLP segment in order to provide data for multiple constellations, satellites or signals. When any such element – with the exception of the GANSS ID and SBAS ID element – appears in more than one segment, the following rules shall apply.
1.	There shall be no repetition of the same data for the same constellation, satellite or signal even though there might be multiple realizations of the IEs for the same constellation, satellite or signal. For example, DGANSS corrections may occur multiple times for the same satellite.

GANSS Reference Time
This field specifies the GANSS Time Of Day (TOD) with uncertainty and relationship between GANSS Reference Time and air-interface timing of the BTS transmission in the reference cell. These fields occur once per message; some are mandatory and some are optional, as shown in Table A.33. 
When GANSS TOD -GSM Time association is present, GANSS TOD and BCCH/BSIC/FNm/TN/BN IEs provide a valid relationship between GANSS TOD and GSM time, as seen at the approximate location of the MS, i.e. the propagation delay from BTS to MS shall be compensated for by the SMLC. Depending on implementation, the relation between GANSS TOD and GSM time may have varying accuracy. Therefore, the uncertainty of the timing relation is provided in GANSS TOD Uncertainty. If the propagation delay from BTS to MS is not accurately known, the SMLC shall use the best available approximation of the propagation delay and take the corresponding delay uncertainty into account in the calculation of the field GANSS TOD Uncertainty. When GANSS TOD -GSM Time association is not present, GANSS TOD is an estimate of current GANSS TOD at time of reception of the RRLP segment containing this data by the MS. The SMLC should achieve an accuracy of +/- 3 seconds for this estimate including allowing for the transmission delay between SMLC and MS of the RRLP segment containing GANSS TOD. Note that the MS should further compensate GANSS TOD for the time between the reception of the segment containing GANSS TOD and the time when the GANSS TOD field is used.

BCCH Carrier/BSIC/FNm/TN/BN/FN1
These fields specify the state of the GSM frame number, respectively, of the reference BTS with the specified BCCH carrier and BSIC at the time that correspond to GANSS TOD. Also, the drift rate of the frame timing, FN1, with respect to the GANSS TOD is optionally given. The SMLC shall use the current serving BTS as the reference BTS. The target MS has the option of rejecting a GANSS position request or GANSS assistance data if the reference BTS is not the serving BTS. If FNm field is present in the assistance, cellular time parameters FNm/TN/BN shall be aligned with the integer GANSS TOD second given in GANSS TOD field.
GANSS Reference Location
The Reference Location field contains a 3-D location (with uncertainty) specified as per 3GPP TS 23.032. The purpose of this field is to provide the MS with a priori knowledge of its location in order to improve GNSS receiver performance. The allowed shape is 3-D location with uncertainty (ellipsoid point with altitude and uncertainty ellipsoid). As defined in 3GPP TS 23.032, the GANSS Reference Location is provided in WGS-84 reference system.
NOTE:	If GPS Assistance Data component is present as well, the SMLC should include the Reference Location either in the GPS Assistance Data or GANSS Common Assistance Data element.
GANSS Ionospheric Model
GANSS Ionospheric Model contains parameters to model the propagation delay of the GNSS signals through the ionosphere. The information elements in this field are shown in Table A.35. Proper use of these fields as defined in [11] allows a single‑frequency GNSS receiver to remove the ionospheric delay from the pseudorange measurements.

Week Number
This field specifies the reference week of GANSS Time Model given in GNSS specific system time. This field is optional.
NOTE:	The time relationship between the system time indicated by GANSS_ID and system time indicated by GNSS_TO_ID is given by the following equation [12,13,14]: 

tGNSS = tE - ( A0GGTO + A1GGTO (tE - tGGTO + 604800 (WN - WNGGTO)) + A2GGTO (tE - tGGTO + 
                    604800 (WN - WNGGTO))2 )

where

tGNSS		is the system time of week for the GNSS indicated by GNSS_TO_ID.
tE			is the system time of week for the GNSS indicated by GANSS_ID.
WN		is the week number of the GNSS system time indicated GANSS_ID corresponding to the tE. 
tGGTO		is the system time of week for the time model data in the GNSS time indicated by
 			GANSS_ID and given by the GANSS Time Model Reference Time field.
WNGGTO	is the week number for the time model data in the GNSS time indicated by GANSS_ID
 			corresponding to the tGGTO and given by the Week Number field.
A0GGTO	is given by the TA0 field.
A1GGTO	is given by the TA1 field.
A2GGTO	is given by the TA2 field.

If the TA1 and TA2  are not included in the GANSS Time Model, the MS assumes  A1GGTO and A2GGTO are equal to zero. 
The GNSS system times in the GANSS Time Model and used in the equation above are all given in Time of Week (TOW) and Week Number (WN) in the indicted GNSS specific system time. For conversion between TOW/WN and Day Number/Time of Day (GANSS Day/GANSS TOD) a GNSS week consists of 7 days since the origin of the particular GNSS System time (with the week number count starting at 0), and a day consists of 86400 seconds.

The first six values in this field indicate valid differential corrections. When using the values described below, the "UDRE Scale Factor" value is applied to the UDRE values contained in the message. The purpose is to indicate an estimate in the amount of error in the corrections.
The value "110" indicates that the source of the differential corrections (e.g., reference station or external DGANSS network) is currently not being monitored. The value "111" indicates that the corrections provided by the source are invalid, as judged by the source. In the later case, the message shall contain no corrections for individual satellites. Any MS that receives DGANSS Corrections in a GANSS Assistance Data IE shall contain the appropriate logic to properly interpret this condition and look for the next IE.

User Differential Range Error (UDRE)
This field provides an estimate of the uncertainty (1-) in the corrections for the particular satellite. The value in this field shall be multiplied by the UDRE Scale Factor in the common Corrections Status/Health field to determine the final UDRE estimate for the particular satellite. The meanings of the values for this field are described in Table A.45.

Each UDRE value shall be adjusted based on the operation of an Integrity Monitor (IM) function which exists at the network (SMLC, GPS server, or reference GPS receiver itself). Positioning errors derived at the IM which are excessive relative to DGPS expected accuracy levels shall be used to scale the UDRE values to produce consistency.
Pseudo-Range Correction (PRC)
This field indicates the correction to the pseudorange for the particular satellite at DGANSS Reference Time,  t0. The value of this field is given in meters (m) and the resolution is 0,32, as shown in Table A.43 above. The method of calculating this field is described in [9].
If the SMLC has received a request for GANSS assistance data from an MS which included a request for the navigation models and DGANSS (i.e., bit J and M are set to one in 'Requested GANSS Assistance Data, see 3GPP TS 49.031), the SMLC shall determine, for each satellite, if the navigation model stored by the MS is still suitable for use with DGANSS corrections (also see navigation model update conditions right before Table A.46) and if so and if DGANSS corrections are supported the SMLC should send DGANSS corrections without including the navigation model.
The IOD value sent for a satellite shall always be the IOD value that corresponds to the navigation model for which the pseudo-range corrections are applicable.
The pseudo-range correction shall correspond to the available navigation model (the one already stored in and identified by the MS or the one included in the same procedure as the pseudo-range correction). The MS shall only use the PRC value when the IOD value received matches its available navigation model.
Pseudo-range corrections are provided with respect to GNSS specific geodetic datum (e.g., PZ-90.02 if GANSS ID indicates GLONASS).
Pseudo-Range Rate Correction (RRC)
This field indicates the rate-of-change of the pseudorange correction for the particular satellite, using the satellite ephemeris and clock corrections identified by the IOD IE. The value of this field is given in meters per second (m/sec) and the resolution is 0,032, as shown in table A.43 above. For some time t1 > t0, the corrections for IOD are estimated by
	PRC(t1, IOD) = PRC(t0, IOD) + RRC(t0, IOD)(t1 - t0) ,
and the MS uses this to correct the pseudorange it measures at t1, PRm(t1, IOD), by
	PR(t1, IOD) = PRm(t1, IOD) + PRC(t1, IOD) .
The SMLC shall always send the RRC value that corresponds to the PRC value that it sends (see above for details). The MS shall only use the RRC value when the IOD value received matches its available navigation model.
GANSS Navigation Model
This set of fields contains information required to manage the transfer of precise navigation data to the GANSS-capable MS. In response to a request from a MS for GANSS Assistance Data, the SMLC shall determine whether to send the navigation model for a particular satellite to an MS based upon factors like the T-Toe limit specified by the MS and any request from the MS for DGANSS (also see above). This information includes control bit fields as well as satellite ephemeris and clock corrections and clock and orbit accuracy models. GANSS Orbit Model can be given in Keplerian parameters  or as state vector in Earth-Centered Earth-Fixed coordinates, dependent on the GANSS-ID and the MS capabilities. The meaning of these parameters is defined in relevant ICDs of the particular GANSS and GNSS specific interpretations apply. For example, Modernized GPS and QZSS use the same model parameters but some parameters have a different interpretation [16].
GANSS Navigation Model element can contain data up to at most 32 satellites. The individual fields are given in Table A.46 and the conditions for their presence is discussed below.

 GANSS Real-Time Integrity
Integrity Monitor (IM) shall detect unhealthy (e.g., failed/failing) satellite signals and also shall inform users of measurement quality in DGANSS modes when satellite signals are healthy. Excessively large pseudo range errors, as evidenced by the magnitude of the corresponding DGANSS correction, shall be used to detect failed satellite signals. Unhealthy satellite signals should be detected within 10 seconds of the occurrence of the satellite signal failure. When unhealthy (e.g., failed/failing) satellite signals are detected, the assistance and/or DGANSS correction data shall not be supplied for these satellite signals. When the error in the IM computed position is excessive for solutions based upon healthy satellite signals only, DGANSS users shall be informed of measurement quality through the supplied UDRE values. After bad satellite signals have been indicated in the Real Time Integrity field, if the satellite signals return to healthy condition for some period of time, the indications for them shall be removed from this field.
GANSS Real-Time Integrity field of the GANSS Assistance Data Information Element contains parameters that describe the real-time status of the GANSS constellations. Primarily intended for non-differential applications, the real-time integrity of the satellite constellation is of importance as there is no differential correction data by which the mobile can determine the soundness of each satellite signal. GANSS Real-Time Integrity data communicates the health of the GNSS signals to the mobile in real-time. The format is shown in Table A.50. The SMLC shall always transmit the GANSS Real Time Integrity field with the current list of unhealthy signals, for any GANSS positioning attempt and whenever GANSS Assistance Data is sent. If the number of bad signals (NBS) is zero, then the GANSS Real Time Integrity field shall be omitted.

In case of BDS, it contains the encoded and interleaved modulation symbols as defined in [18] section 5.1.3.
GANSS Reference Measurement Information
This field provides reference code and Doppler measurement information of visible satellites of a GANSS constellation. The information can be used as acquisition assistance to improve the sensitivity of the receiver. 
These parameters describe the range and optionally the derivatives from respective satellites to the GANSS Reference Location at the GANSS Reference Time. The code phase and Doppler fields are aligned with the time provided in GANSS Reference Time. Figure A.4a illustrates the relation between some of the fields with respect to the GANSS TOD.
If GPS Acquisition Assistance is included the Reference Time included in the GPS Acquisition Assistance is also valid for the GANSS Reference Measurement fields and the parameters are referenced to GPS TOW. Figure A.4b illustrates the relation between some of the fields with respect to GPS TOW.
The parameters are given in units of ms and m/s which makes it possible to convert the values to any nominal frequency and chipping and code rate.

Doppler (1st order term) is given in unit of m/s by multiplying the Doppler value in Hz by the nominal wavelength of the assisted signal.
This field is optional.
Doppler Uncertainty
This field contains the Doppler uncertainty value. It is defined such that the Doppler experienced by a stationary MS is in the range "Doppler  Doppler Uncertainty" to "Doppler  Doppler Uncertainty". This field is optional. If Doppler Uncertainty (together with Doppler 1st order term) is omitted, the terminal shall interpret Doppler Uncertainty as greater than +/-40 m/s. If the Doppler Uncertainty Extension (Table A.55.25) field is present, the MS that supports the Doppler Uncertainty Extension shall ignore this field.
Doppler Uncertainty is given in unit of m/s by multiplying the Doppler Uncertainty value in Hz by the nominal wavelength of the assisted signal.
Permitted Values:	2,5 m/s, 5 m/s, 10 m/s, 20 m/s, 40 m/s as encoded by an integer n in the range 0-4 according to the formula in Table A.52.
Code Phase
This field together with the Code Phase_1023 field contains code phase, in units of milliseconds, in the range from 0 to 1 millisecond scaled by the nominal chipping rate of the GNSS signal, where increasing values of the field signify increasing predicted signal code phases, as seen by a receiver at the Reference Location at the GANSS Reference Time. The Reference Location would typically be an apriori estimate of the MS location. This field is mandatory.
Range: 	0 - (1-2-10) ms
NOTE:	The value (1-2-10) ms is encoded using the Code Phase_1023 field.
Integer Code Phase
This field contains integer code phase (expressed modulo 128 ms). The satellite integer milliseconds code phase currently being transmitted at the GANSS Reference Time, as seen by a receiver at the Reference Location is calculated as reference time (GANSS TOD or GPS TOW, expressed in milliseconds) minus (Integer_Code_Phase + (n×128 ms)), as shown in Figure A.4a/b, with n = …-2,-1,0,1,2…. This field is mandatory.
Range: 	0-127 ms
Code Phase Search Window
This field contains the code phase search window. The code phase search window accounts for the uncertainty in the estimated MS location but not any uncertainty in GANSS Reference Time. It is defined such that the expected code phase is in the range "Code Phase - Code Phase Search Window" to "Code Phase + Code Phase Search Window" given in units of milliseconds. This field is mandatory.
Range: 	0-31 (i.e. 0,002 - 2,000 ms according to following table)

Azimuth
This field together with the Azimuth LSB  included in GANSS Reference Measurement Extension in Table A.55.23contains the azimuth angle. An angle of x degrees means the satellite azimuth a is in the range (x  a < x+0,703125) degrees. This field is optional.
Range: 	0 - 359,296875 degrees.
Elevation
This field together with the Elevation LSB included in GANSS Reference Measurement Extension in Table A.55.23 contains the elevation angle. An angle of y degrees means the satellite elevation e is in the range (y  e < y+0,703125) degrees except for y = 89,296875 where the range is extended to include 90 degrees. This field is optional.
Range: 	0 - 89,296875 degrees
Code Phase_1023
This field if set to TRUE indicates that the code phase has the value 1023 × 2-10 = (1-2-10) ms. This field may only be set to TRUE if the value provided in the Code Phase  field is 1022. If this field is set to FALSE, the code phase is the value provided in the Code Phase  field in the range from 0 to (1 - 2×2-10) ms. If this field is not present and the Code Phase  field  has the value 1022, the MS  may assume that the code phase is between (1 - 2×2-10)  and (1 - 2-10) ms.
GANSS Almanac Model
These fields specify the coarse, long-term model of the satellite positions and clocks. These fields are given in Table A.54. The meaning of these parameters is defined in relevant ICDs of the particular GANSS and GNSS specific interpretations apply. For example, Modernized GPS and QZSS use the same model parameters but some parameters have a different interpretation [16].
GANSS Almanac Model is useful for receiver tasks that require coarse accuracy, such as determining satellite visibility. The model is valid for up to few weeks, typically. Since it is a long-term model, the field should be provided for all satellites in the GNSS constellation. If almanac is not provided for the full GNSS constellation, the SMLC shall set the Complete Almanac Provided  field in Table A.55.24 to FALSE.

GANSS Ephemeris Extension
The GANSS Ephemeris extension contains parameters designed to extend the time of applicability of the Ephemeris terms by the continuous addition of the delta ephemeris terms to the respective terms of the referenced ephemeris.
This message can provide extension information for every satellite for many days into the future; doing so may create a large message, thus care must be taken to consider the transport bandwidth.  The SMLC can limit the duration of the extension to decrease the message size.  For example if the extension duration is limited to twelve hours the payload will be approximately 2,000 octets, for a typical 27 satellite constellation.

GANSS Delta Element List
GANSS Delta Element List is a list of GANSS Ephemeris Delta Elements
Ephemeris Delta Element
Each GANSS Ephemeris Delta element is uniquely identified by the pair (seqNum, sv_ID) and it is defined as a structure as shown in table A.55.11. The MS should parse the octet string according to the fields specified in table A.55.4. Each element in table A.55.4 but for seqNum and sv_ID should be treated as a signed integer.  Each Ephemeris delta is transmitted as an octet string of up to 49 octets.  The actual number of octets is determined by the size of the bit fields in the GPS_Ephemeris_Delta_Sizes table (table A.55.9).  Each set of up to 49 octets represents a single extension for a single satellite vehicle.  Each set encodes the satellite vehicle ID and the sequence number.  The sequence number specifies the order in which the individual ephemeris extension elements are assembled as time marches forward to create the next ephemeris.  The sequence number is the same for all satellite vehicle IDs for a particular update period.

(1)	The number of bits of each signed integer field is variable and it is indicated once for all numEphemerisDeltas by the structure ephemerisDeltasSizes.  When the ephemerisDeltaSizes field is not present, the values found in the columns "Default # Bits" shall be used.
(2)	The scale factor of each parameter is variable around the default scale factor. The variation for each field is indicated once for all numEphemerisDeltas by the structure ephemerisDeltasScales. For example, if the scale factor modifier for delta_omega has a value of 4, the scale factor for delta_omega is 24 * 2-31.  When the ephemerisDeltaScales is not used, the values found in the column "Default Scale" shall be used.
sequenceNum
This field indicates the order of the Ephemeris delta terms.  The ephemeris constructed for use in satellite positioning is built by adding the delta terms to the referenced GANSS_Navigation Model in the order dictated by this sequence number.  The sequence number shall remain the same for each svID in a group of Ephemeris Deltas corresponding to a particular update epoch.
svID
This field identifies the satellite ID within a particular sequenceNum.
These fields, with the exception of sequenceNum and svID, specify the deltas to be added to the existing Ephemeris to create a new Ephemeris suite that is extended from its predecessor by the time provided in the "validityPeriod" parameter. To compute the time of ephemeris for the newly constructed ephemeris, validityPeriod is added to the preceding toe.  The ephemeris time of clock (toc) is set equal to the toe.
For each of the other ephemeris terms the corresponding delta ephemeris term is added in order to create the updated ephemeris. The terms delta_M0, delta_i0, and delta_OMEGA0 of the delta ephemeris must be extrapolated prior to the addition of the delta terms as follows:

Where  is the WGS 84 value of the earth's gravitational constant for GANSS user, and A(i) is the semi-major axis associated with this satellite's update. The extrapolation of delta_M0, uses the prior set's sqrtA term to compute A(i) .

OMEGA0(i+1)=OMEGA0(i) +deltaOMEGA0(i)+OMEGAdot(i)*dt
i0 (i+1) = i0(i) + delta_i0(i)+Idot(i) * dt 
Where dt is equal to validityPeriod*3600. The terms af0, and af1 from the GANSS clock model must be extrapolated as follows:
af0(i+1) = af0(i) + af1(i)* dt + af2(i)*dt2
af1(i+1) = af1(i) + 2 * af2(i) * dt
af2(i+1) = af2(i)
Where af0, af1, and af2 are the clock model terms as shown in table A.49.1.
The following demonstrates the application of the ephemeris extension technique. Assume the validityPeriod = 5, representing: (5+1)hours = 6 hours, and the GANSS Navigation model for a particular satellite, identified by the reference IOD has a toe = 0 seconds.
The toe for sequenceNumber 1 is computed by adding the validityPeriod to the initial toe of 0 as 0 + 6 hours =0 + 21600 seconds.  The new ephemeris is constructed by adding the delta ephemeris terms from set 1 to the reference ephemeris creating the new ephemeris, which will be used for the next six hours. For the five terms listed above (delta_M0, delta_i0, delta_OMEGA0, af0, and af1) the extrapolation described must occur prior to the addition of the delta term. Of course if one of these three delta ephemeris terms was provided in full via the exception table then the extrapolation is unnecessary and the exception term combined with the delta_ephemeris term is used directly.
The next ephemeris computation will occur by adding the validityPeriod to the current toe of 21600 as: 21600 + 6 hours = 21600 + 21600 = 43200. The ephemeris delta terms from set two are added to the ephemeris resulting from the prior addition to create the next ephemeris. This is done for each satellite vehicle ID listed in the provided satellite list indicated in the ganssSatRef field.
GANSS Ephemeris Extension check
The GANSS Ephemeris Extension check provides information about non foreseen events that occurred during the period starting at the ganssBeginTime to the current time. An event is signified through a bit string . Each bits refers to one PRN. If a bit is set to one, this means that the ephemeris extension is no longer valid for this specific PRN.  In order to indicate planned future manuvers an end time is provided.  The SMLC can indicate that a future event is planned between the current time and the end time of this ephemeris extension.

A.9.2	Elements
A.9.2.1	Target-Number-of-Cells Element
This field is a 3 bit integer used to indicate the optimum number of cells a MS is to use when performing the radio access part of the MTA procedure. This field is mandatory, and has the following values:

0 0 0 : 	2 cells
0 0 1 :	3 cells
…
1 1 1 :	9 cells
A.9.2.2	Requested-MS-Synchronization-Accuracy Element
This field is a 4 bit integer used to indicate the synchronization accuracy the MS should attempt to realize when performing the radio access part of the MTA procedure using the RLC Data Block method or the Extended Access Burst method and is coded as per the value part of the MS Synchronization Accuracy IE defined in 3GPP TS 49.031 [7]. The synchronization accuracy requested by this field shall be ignored when performing the radio access part of the MTA procedure using the Access Burst method.
A.9.2.3	MTA-Method
This field indicates the MTA method the MS is to use when performing the radio access part of the MTA procedure and allows for indicating the following methods.

RLC Data Block:	If this method is indicated then no additional information is included within the MTA-Method information. 
Access Burst:	If this method is indicated then no additional information is included within the MTA-Method information. 
Extended Access Burst:	If this method is indicated then the Short BSS ID field is included as part of the MTA-Method information. 

These methods require that either PEO or EC-GSM-IoT operation is enabled in the MS. If EC-GSM-IoT operation is enabled but CC1 is not used on the uplink then the MS shall use the RLC Data Block method (if supported). If neither PEO or EC-GSM-IoT operation is enabled the MS shall not perform the commanded MTA procedure. 
Short-BSS-ID 
This parameter identifies the serving BSS within a cluster of BSS areas and is used for the Extended Access Burst method. The Short BSS ID together with a Random ID value identify the target MS for the Multilateration Timing Advance procedure in a unique way in the network.
A.9.2.4	Random-ID
This parameter is used by a MS when it performs the radio access part of the MTA procedure using the RLC Data Block or Extended Access Burst method. The Random ID value sent by a MS performing the radio access part of the MTA procedure is selected from a set of up to 9 Random ID values provided by the RRLP Multilateration Timing Advance Request message. Each Random ID value provided by the RRLP message can only be used in one cell used by a MS when performing the radio access part of the MTA procedure. After reception by the BSS it is sent to the SMLC along with corresponding MTA timing advance information using a SCCP connection that the Random ID is logically associated with (i.e. when the SMLC first allocates a set of Random ID values for inclusion in a RRLP message they will always be associated with a SCCP connection used by the SMLC for an ongoing MTA procedure). The reception of any one of the allocated Random ID values along with corresponding MTA timing advance information therefore allows the SMLC to validate the timing advance information.
A.9.2.5	MPM-Timer
This field is a 3 bit integer used to indicate the maximum amount of time the MS can use to perform the radio access part of the MTA procedure and is coded as per the MPM Timer field defined in 3GPP TS 49.031 [7].
A.9.2.6	Serving-Cell
This field is set to ‘1’ if the SMLC requests the MS to include the serving cell when performing the radio access part of the MTA procedure.
A.9.2.7	Co-Sited-Cells
This field identifies the set of cells that are co-sited with the serving cell and therefore shall not be used by the MS when performing the radio access part of the MTA procedure.
A.9.2.8	Cell-Set N
This field provides assistance information for one or more sets of cells wherein information for at least one cell is provided within each Cell Set for which assistance information is provided. When multiple cells are identified for a given Cell Set then each cell in the set is co-sited and the MS shall therefore use at most one cell from the set when performing the radio access part of the MTA procedure. If the ARFCN and BSIC of the serving cell is included for a cell within a Cell Set then the MS shall use that cell when performing the radio access part of the MTA procedure. 
Short-ID
This parameter identifies the cell specific Short ID value to be sent from the MS to the BSS when the MS performs the radio access part of the MTA procedure in a cell using the Access Burst method.  It is part of the MTA related measurement information passed from the BSS to the SMLC and is used by the SMLC to validate the corresponding MTA related measurement information it receives for that cell. 
ARFCN
This field is the binary representation of the absolute radio frequency channel number (ARFCN) defined in 3GPP TS 45.005.
BSIC-Info
This field identifies the 9 bit BSIC (see 3GPP TS 45.003 and 3GPP TS 45.008) associated with the indicated ARFCN. 
EC-Cell-Information
When a cell supports EC-GSM-IoT the corresponding EC-RACH-Control-Parameters may be included as part of the assistance information. If excluded for that cell the MS shall default to using the EC-RACH-Control-Parameters provided for any other cell in that set. If EC-RACH-Control-Parameters are not provided for any cell in a set of cells that support EC-GSM-IoT then the MS shall read the EC-BCCH for the cell in that cell set that it chooses to use to perform the Multilateration Timing Advance procedure and thereby acquire the required EC-RACH-Control-Parameters information.
PEO-Cell-Information
When a cell supports PEO the corresponding RACH-Control-Parameters may be included as part of the assistance information. If excluded for that cell the MS shall default to using the RACH-Control-Parameters provided for any other cell in that set. If RACH-Control-Parameters are not provided for any cell in a set of cells that support PEO then the MS shall read the BCCH for the cell in that cell set that it chooses to use to perform the Multilateration Timing Advance procedure and thereby acquire the required RACH-Control-Parameters information.
EC-BS-CC-CHANS 
This field is a 2 bit integer and indicates the number of extended coverage common control channels (EC-CCCHs) supported in the cell (see 3GPP TS 44.018).

MS shall estimate the DL sync accuracy (i.e MS Sync Accuracy (see 3GPP TS 45.010)) on reception of every additional synchronisation burst reception. MS stops further reception and processing of synchronisation bursts if the estimated downlink sync accuracy is better than the required DL synchronisation accuracy or the maximum number of synchronisation iterations is already reached.
A.10.2.3	Serving Cell Set
This element contains the list of cells which are co-sited with the serving cell. MS shall avoid OTD measurements on the cells from this cell set. Each information element consists of ARFCN and BSIC of the cell as shown in Table A.64.

MOTD Measurements Parameter
ARFCN
BSIC

A.10.2.4	Neighbour Cell Sets
This information element provides up to 8 cell sets where each neighbour cell set consists of information about co-sited cells of (at least) one neighbour cell site. The co-sited cell information is used by MS while measuring the OTD with the neighbour cells. The MS shall measure the OTD only with the strongest cell per neighbour cell set.
Each Cell set information element indicates the ARFCN and BSIC of the cell (refer to Table A.64).
A.11	Multilateration OTD Response
A.11.1	General
The Multilateration OTD (MOTD) Response is a RRLP component from the MS to network. This message is sent by the MS in response to the Multilateration OTD Request message containing the multilateration OTD measurement results.

A.11.2	Elements
A.11.2.1	Serving Cell Downlink Synchronisation Accuracy
This element indicates the downlink synchronisation accuracy estimated for the serving cell at MS when it measures the OTD with neighbour cells for Multilateration OTD Response. 

A.11.2.2	MOTD Measurement Results
This element consists of up to 7 OTD Measurement Information elements each containing the OTD measurement results along with the cell related information. OTD Measurement Information is shown in Table A.66.

MS Synchronisation Accuracy
OTD Measurement Result

The MS Synchronisation Accuracy 
This parameter refers to the estimated synchronisation accuracy of the cell for which the OTD measurement with respect to serving cell is measured. MS estimates the synchronisation accuracy based on received downlink synchronisation bursts as specified in 3GPP TS 45.010.
Reported Cell
This field indicates whether the reported cell is cell index within the CellSets given on MOTD Measurement Request message or combination of BSIC and ARFCN.
'0' =	Reported Cell is given as the index to the cell in the serving Cell Set and Neighbour Cell Sets provided in the MOTD Measurement Request.
'1' =	Reported Cell is given as BSIC(9 bit) and ARFCN of the cell.

CellIdx
The index of the cell within the Serving Cell Set and Neighbour Cell Sets provided in the MOTD Measurement Request message. The index spans across all the cells of the Serving Cell Set and Neighbour Cell Sets. (For example Index 0 refers to the first cell in the ServingCellSet. If ServingCellSet contains 3 cells, then index 3 refers to the first cell of the first Neighbour Cell Set).

OTD Measurement Result 
This parameter indicates the observed time difference between the TDMA frame timing of the measured cell and the serving cell. The time difference is reported modulo 125 normal symbol periods in terms of 1/8 normal symbol period granularity. (For example, if the TDMA frame timing of the neighbour cell is observed to be ⅛ normal symbol period earlier than the TDMA frame timing of the serving cell, 8·((1250-⅛) mod 125) = 999 is reported.)

A.11.2.3	MOTD Receive Level Measurements
This element is included in the MOTD Measurement Response when only one MOTD measurement result can be reported as part of the MOTD Measurement Response. This element consists of Receive Level Information parameters for all neighbour cells that the MS can receive, each consisting of receive level measurement and the cell identity related information. The MOTD Receive Level Measurement Information parameter is shown in Table A.67.
